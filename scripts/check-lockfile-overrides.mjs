// Fails when a `pnpm.overrides` target in package.json no longer covers every
// resolved instance of that package in pnpm-lock.yaml. pnpm's override-key
// matching is declared-range intersection against a *dependent's* declared
// specifier, not natural-resolution matching (see
// .cadence/phases/253-dependency-override-remediation/253-01-T3-EVIDENCE.md,
// Finding 2) — a stale or non-intersecting override key is silently ignored
// with no error, so this detector re-derives coverage directly from the
// committed lockfile instead of trusting that the override "must still be
// doing something" because it's present in package.json.
//
// Pure decision logic (extractOverrideTargets / parseLockfilePackages /
// checkOverrideCoverage) is exported and unit-tested in
// packages/core/tests/docs/check-lockfile-overrides.test.ts; main() is the
// thin, impure shell that reads the two real files and prints/exits —
// mirroring scripts/check-audit-exceptions.mjs's pure/impure split. This is
// pure file-parsing (package.json + pnpm-lock.yaml already on disk after
// `pnpm install`), so no subprocess is needed.

/**
 * Checks every resolved lockfile instance of an overridden package against
 * its override target(s). Matching is keyed off the *target range's floor
 * major version*, not the override key's source-version major — an override
 * like `read-yaml-file@1.1.0: ^2.1.0` moves the resolved major from 1 to 2,
 * so source-major matching would find nothing to check.
 *
 * A resolved instance whose package name has no override target at all is
 * out of this detector's scope (not every lockfile package is overridden).
 * A resolved instance whose package name HAS at least one override target,
 * but whose own major-version line matches none of them, is an
 * 'unguarded-line' failure (today's real committed state: brace-expansion's
 * 5.x line is covered, its 2.x line isn't). A resolved instance that matches
 * a target's major but doesn't satisfy that target's range is an
 * 'unsatisfied' failure.
 *
 * A declared override target whose package name matches none of
 * `lockfilePackages` is never visited by the loop above at all (there is no
 * instance to iterate), so it earns its own pass: any target package name
 * with zero matching instances is reported as `'unresolved-target'` — the
 * key is either dead weight left over from a removed/renamed dependency, or
 * a typo silently doing nothing.
 *
 * Scope: this "matched at least once" check is keyed on the target's
 * *package name*, not on each individual target — a package with multiple
 * override targets (different `sourceVersion`s) is exempt from
 * `unresolved-target` as long as ANY one of its targets' major lines
 * resolves somewhere in the lockfile, even if a different sibling target for
 * that same package matches nothing. Today's real committed config has such
 * a pair (`brace-expansion@5.0.6` and `brace-expansion@^2.0.0`); only the
 * first currently resolves, and the second is deliberately still not flagged
 * by this check for that reason — tightening this to per-target granularity
 * would report it and break CI (`lockfile-overrides-current-state.test.ts`
 * asserts `failures: []` against the real committed state). Per-target
 * granularity, if ever wanted, needs its own opt-in suppression mechanism
 * first (see `docs/security/audit-exceptions.md`'s pattern).
 *
 * Returns `{ ok, failures }` where each failure is
 * `{ package, range, resolvedVersion, instance, reason }`, plus
 * `sourceVersion` on `'unresolved-target'` failures (the override key's
 * literal source-version half, so a message can name the actual
 * `package.json` key rather than just the package name).
