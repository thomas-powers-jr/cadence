 * (a task marked DONE whose test mentions its AC but never asserts on it),
 * settle REFUSES to close, the demo restores the real assertion, and settle
 * then genuinely passes. The refusal is the money moment.
 *
 * Every step composes the real engine services — no `--ac` manual assertion
 * and no coverage bypass — so the walkthrough can never drift from real
 * behavior, and a skeptic could reproduce each command by hand.
 *
 * This is `tutorial.ts`'s command generalized (phase 278): the beat/pause/
 * scaffold shape is deliberately parallel (tutorial.ts is out of T2's file
 * boundary and is not modified by this task), but the flag defaults are
 * inverted — `cadence demo` is fully non-interactive by default so it is
 * safe to run from a bare `npx` invocation or an agent shell without ever
 * blocking on input, and `--interactive`/`-i` opts back into the tutorial's
 * TTY-paced pauses.
