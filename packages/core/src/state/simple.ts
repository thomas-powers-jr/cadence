  /**
   * Telemetry-exempt write path (Phase 194 / issue #234). See the
   * `StateBackend` interface doc for the full rationale — this deliberately
   * skips the `revision` compare-and-swap `commit()` performs so a
   * telemetry-only counter bump can never throw `StateConflictError` or
   * invalidate another writer's in-flight snapshot.
   *
   * Re-reads `state.json` fresh (never trusts a caller-held in-memory
   * copy), bumps the named field on that snapshot, and writes the whole
   * snapshot back — unconditionally, with no compare-and-swap. This
   * narrows (versus the bug this exists to fix) but does not fully close
   * one race: if a `commit()` elsewhere reads, checks, and writes in the
   * gap between this method's own read and write, this write will still
   * land and silently overwrite that commit's structural change with this
   * method's stale copy plus the bumped counter — no error either side.
   * That window is a single read→write round trip (this repo has no lock
   * file), versus the multi-minute `host-cli` gate window that produced
   * issue #234, so the residual risk is accepted as deliberately, vastly
   * narrower than the bug being fixed — a trade-off made on purpose for a
   * telemetry field nothing structural depends on, not an accidental side
   * effect of skipping `commit()`'s guard. Since phase 305 the same window
   * also opens once per `UserPromptSubmit` (the `tokenUtilization` bump), so
   * it is reached far more often than per subagent spawn; each occurrence is
   * still a single read→write round trip.
