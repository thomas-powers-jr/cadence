 * explain` still verifies only existence) is intentional and recorded, not
 * an oversight.
 *
 * Phase 250 (AC-5): a managed marker alone is no longer sufficient — an
 * entry installed before the npm-scope rename still carries
 * `_managedBy: "cadence"` but its `command` string invokes the old
 * `@manehorizons`-scoped package. That entry is stale, not properly managed,
 * so it no longer counts here. Composed at the whole-document level (not
 * folded into a single per-entry check) so that even one stale entry among
 * several managed entries is enough to report "not managed" — a real
 * install always rewrites every managed entry with the same command
 * (`host-claude-code/src/install.ts`), so a mixed document shouldn't occur
 * in practice, but this stays correct if it ever does. `doctor`'s existing
 * `host-install`/`codex-host-install` repair (`packages/core/src/doctor/fix.ts`)
 * already re-runs install and rewrites the command once this predicate
 * reports `false` — no change needed there.
