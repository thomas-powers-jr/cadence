## 1.54.0

### Minor Changes

- 8b42ff4: Renamed the npm scope to `@thomas-powers-jr` across all five published
  packages, matching the GitHub org rename in #360. This is a rename of
  existing software on its existing 1.x version lineage, not a new product —
  consistent with the standing pre-v2.0.0 semver policy.

  The previously-published packages under the old scope are not deleted —
  they stay resolvable and get `npm deprecate`d with a pointer to the new
  scope, as a separate operator-run step after this release. See
  [docs/migration-npm-scope.md](../docs/migration-npm-scope.md) for the full
  migration path, including the exact `cadence doctor --fix --wire-host`
  command that repairs an existing consumer's host-adapter hook install.

  `cadence doctor`'s host-hooks and `cadence config explain`'s warnings both
  now distinguish a hook entry that's missing entirely from one that's
  present but still pointing at the old scope — previously both cases
  reported the same "not found" message, which was factually wrong for the
  second case.

## 1.52.0

### Minor Changes

- 127a06b: **BREAKING (engine floor): minimum supported Node.js raised from `>=20` to
  `>=22`.** Node 20 reaches its scheduled end-of-life in April 2026, and Phase
  238 retires the Node 20 CI/test leg across the monorepo (see
  `.cadence/phases/238-drop-node20-support/`) — these packages are no longer
  tested against, or guaranteed to work on, Node 20 or 21. Shipped as a minor
  bump rather than major, matching the precedent set by the Zod v3→v4 upgrade
  (`[1.4.0]`): no external adopters are affected at release time, and CADENCE
  is reserving its first major/2.0.0 release for when the full coupling of
  Cadence is complete.

  Every published package's `package.json` now declares
  `"engines": { "node": ">=22" }`. Consumers still on Node 20 or 21 should
  upgrade their Node.js runtime before installing or running any package at
  this version or later — by default, npm and pnpm only _warn_ on an
  `engines` mismatch (this repo does not set `engine-strict`), but CI
  pipelines or environments with `engine-strict` enabled will fail outright,
  and pipelines pinned to Node 20 should bump their Node version to keep
  using the `cadence` CLI, either host adapter, or
  `@manehorizons/cadence-types`.

## 1.51.1

### Patch Changes

- 655663e: Unify the five Praxis intelligence ledgers (recommendations, evidence,
  assumptions, decisions, milestones) onto one shared read/write/id-minting
  module (`intelligence/store/ledger.ts`) instead of five independently
  hand-rolled implementations, so a safeguard added for one subject — like
  phase 219's cross-ledger id-collision check, previously recommendations-only
  — now applies to all four minting subjects (recommendations, evidence,
  assumptions, decisions) instead of needing to be re-patched per subject.
  Each subject's existing read/write/mint function names and signatures are
  unchanged (thin wrappers over the shared primitives); bespoke per-subject
  logic (recommendation promotion/archive/unarchive, decision supersession)
  stays subject-specific rather than being forced into one generic shape.

  Also fixes a real gap this refactor surfaced: `milestones.json` was the only
  one of the five ledger files not written with `{ mode: 0o600 }`.

  `cadence intelligence audit`/`reconcile`/`stats` now include milestones as a
  fifth ledger: a new `orphan-milestone` finding kind catches a milestone
  referencing a recommendation id that no longer exists in either the live or
  archived recommendation arrays (a reference to a merely-archived, still
  `unarchive`-recoverable recommendation is correctly NOT flagged).

  `cadence recommendation/decision/assumption list`'s `--sort-by`/
  `--filter-regex`/`--filter-regex-flags` validation is now one shared
  pipeline instead of three independently maintained copies — behavior and
  error wording are unchanged.

  `cadence-types`, `cadence-host-claude-code`, and `cadence-host-codex` carry
  version-alignment bumps only; none of the three changed.

- e05922e: Fix `cadence recommendation add`'s id-minting to cross-check `evidence.json`
  (phase 219, rec-20260724-013). `nextRecommendationId` previously derived the
  next `rec-YYYYMMDD-NNN` id only from `recommendations.json`, so a dangling
  `evidence.json` row left behind by a bad rebase-conflict resolution or an
  interrupted `add` call — a `recommendationId` reference with no matching
  `recommendations.json` entry — could silently collide with a freshly minted
  id for an unrelated recommendation. The minted id is now guaranteed strictly
  greater than both the `recommendations.json` max and the max
  `recommendationId` referenced by `evidence.json` for the same date prefix.

  Also adds a new `orphaned-evidence` `cadence doctor` check that surfaces any
  `evidence.json` row whose `recommendationId` has no matching
  `recommendations.json` entry, naming the evidence id and the missing
  recommendation id — so this class of drift is caught immediately instead of
  surviving unnoticed.

  `cadence-types`, `cadence-host-claude-code`, and `cadence-host-codex` carry
  version-alignment bumps only; none of the three changed.

- 1f70e66: Extracts the logic host-claude-code and host-codex duplicated into a new
  shared package, `@manehorizons/cadence-host-toolkit`:

  - The hook-event routing algorithm's shape and the slash-command catalog
    (`COMMANDS`) now live in `host-toolkit/src/routing.ts`. Both adapters
    render their slash commands from this one catalog, which fixes a real
    drift bug: host-codex's local copy had silently lost `cadence-dispatch`'s
    `DISPATCH_DIALOGUE` body. Host-codex's own `mapEvent`/`extractPayload`/
    `routeHookEvent` stay local — its `apply_patch`-based extraction is
    genuinely different from host-claude-code's `file_path`-based extraction,
    not just duplicated; only the structurally-identical `RouteResult` type is
    shared.
  - `install.ts`'s managed-marker merge logic and `locate-self.ts` are also
    extracted into the toolkit, with one shared test suite; both adapters'
    own `install.ts`/`locate-self.ts` are now thin wrappers.
  - Core now enforces a new `HostCapabilities.agentIdentification` flag: a
    host that declares it cannot supply `agentId`/`agentType` (Codex, whose
    hook payload shape doesn't document one) causes core to notice loudly on
    stderr instead of silently behaving as if no subagent were involved.
    Codex's CLI now embeds its declared capabilities into the real hook
    payload it sends to `cadence hook`, so the check is live end-to-end, not
    just testable in isolation.

  No CLI-facing behavior, flags, or exit codes changed for either adapter —
  this is an internal dedup/extraction plus one new loud-notice-on-a-capability-
  gap fix, not a rewrite. `HostAdapter`'s public contract is unchanged.

## 1.50.0

### Minor Changes

- 42deb4b: Adds `cadence next`, a read-only command that answers "what now?" deterministically from live loop state at any position — 1-3 ranked legal moves with exact commands, plus a stable `--json` contract (`{schemaVersion: 1, position, remainingTasks, blockedOn, legalMoves[]}`) for agent orchestrators. Sourced from an extended `nextAction()` (`packages/core/src/progress.ts`), which now also computes ranked `legalMoves[]` alongside its existing `{command, reason}` shape — strictly additive; `cadence progress` and `cadence quickstart` are unchanged. Closes rec-20260721-002.

  Registers `/cadence-next` as the 15th Claude Code slash command and the matching Codex prompt command (both host adapters share the `COMMAND_GUIDANCE` catalog in `@manehorizons/cadence-types`).

  Also narrows `cadence status --json` and `cadence quickstart --json`'s `next` field to `{command, reason}` explicitly — both were passing `nextAction()`'s full return through unnarrowed, so the new `legalMoves[]` array would otherwise have silently leaked into those two commands' existing public JSON contracts (mirrors the narrowing `cadence progress` already had).

## 1.44.0

### Minor Changes

- e3179cf: Add real assertion-mode test-coverage span parsing for Python, Go, Rust, and PHP (previously js/ts only), plus an operator-extensible escape hatch for any other language.
  - A shared, profile-parameterized scanning engine (`packages/core/src/verify/coverage-profiles/`) replaces the old hardcoded JS/TS-only scanner. Four block-boundary strategies — call-expression, brace-delimited, indentation-delimited, and do-end-keyword — cover every built-in profile and remain available to custom ones.
  - Five built-in language profiles ship: js/ts (re-expressed, byte-identical behavior to before), python (pytest-style, including `async def`), go (`func TestX(t *testing.T)`, table-driven tests, testify), rust (`#[test]`/`#[should_panic]`, unbounded raw strings), and php (both Pest closures and PHPUnit methods, including heredoc/nowdoc-safe masking).
  - `verification.coverageProfiles` lets an operator define a custom profile (opener/assertion patterns, comment/string syntax, block strategy) for any language with no built-in support — validated at config-load time with refuse+suggest diagnostics; custom profiles are add-only and cannot override a built-in's extensions.
  - `cadence verify coverage --explain AC-N [--json]` is a new read-only diagnostic: which files matched, which profile scanned each one, every span found, and why each did or didn't satisfy assertion mode.
  - Per-file dispatch is wired into the real `test-coverage` gate (`scanTestCoverage`) — assertion mode now genuinely works end-to-end for all five built-in languages, not just in isolation. The gate's refusal messages are language-neutral and point at the new `--explain` diagnostic. `cadence init`'s default `verification.testGlobs` for rust now also includes `src/**/*.rs`, since idiomatic Rust unit tests commonly live inline in a `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { ... }` block. `cadence doctor`'s coverage-mode language-support check now reflects the live profile registry instead of a hardcoded js-only list.
  - The false-positive-averse invariant holds throughout: an unrecognized shape always yields zero spans, never a partial or fabricated match. This required closing several real gaps found during review — opener-pattern spoofing via comments, strings, and nested parenthesized sub-expressions (go); an unbounded-hash raw-string masking gap (rust); a standalone-heredoc fabricated-span gap (php); and a cross-process custom-profile collision-shadowing gap (`verification.coverageProfiles`).

### Patch Changes

- a5b21ec: Fix `cadence init` defaulting `verification.coverageMode` to `'assertion'` for every project regardless of language, which made the `test-coverage` gate permanently unsatisfiable for non-JS/TS projects (the assertion-mode span-finder only recognizes JS/TS `it()`/`test()` syntax).
  - `cadence init` now detects the project's language from root marker files (`package.json`→js/ts, `pyproject.toml`/`setup.py`/`requirements.txt`→python, `go.mod`→go, `Cargo.toml`→rust, `composer.json`→php) and only defaults `coverageMode` to `'assertion'` when the detected language is js/ts; every other detected or unknown language defaults to `'mention'` instead, with a stderr notice explaining why. Existing `.cadence/config.json` files are never rewritten.
  - Default `verification.testGlobs` are now language-aware too, so `mention`-mode coverage checking can actually discover test files in non-JS projects (python: `**/test_*.py`, `**/*_test.py`; go: `**/*_test.go`; rust: `tests/**/*.rs`, `**/*_test.rs`; php: `**/*Test.php`, `tests/**/*.php`).
  - The `test-coverage` gate's assertion-mode refusal message now distinguishes its causes accurately: no test file matched the configured globs at all, vs. files matched but no test references the AC, vs. files matched and reference the AC but not inside an asserting `it()`/`test()` block — each with its own suggested fix.
  - `cadence doctor` (and the MCP `doctor` tool) now warns when `coverageMode: 'assertion'` is paired with a detected project language that has no assertion-mode parsing support yet, suggesting `cadence config edit coverageMode`.

  This does not add real assertion-mode test-span parsing for Python/Go/Rust/PHP — only js/ts has that today. It closes the "permanently unsatisfiable gate" failure mode for every language by making the defaults and diagnostics honest.

- 8bf3135: Fix `test-coverage` gate in `assertion` coverage mode wrongly treating an AC whose only linked test sits inside a `test.skip`/`.todo`/`.failing` block as fully covered, even when the block contains an intact assertion. Previously `cadence settle run --auto` would settle clean (exit 0) on a skipped test; the gate now refuses with a distinct message ("AC-N's only linked test is skipped") separate from the existing "no linked test" and "mentioned but not asserting" refusals, naming the fix (unskip the test or replace it with a running asserting block) rather than suggesting an unrelated `coverageMode` switch.

  `findTestSpans` now flags `skip`/`todo`/`failing` openers as non-asserting spans (`only`/`concurrent` are unaffected, since those execute normally); `scanTestCoverage` propagates this through a new `skipped` flag on each test reference, and a new `skippedOnlyLinkedAcs` export is mutually exclusive with the existing `weaklyLinkedAcs` — an AC only lands in the new bucket when every one of its non-qualifying references is skip-caused. `mention`-mode coverage is unaffected.

## 1.43.0

### Minor Changes

- Enable `cadence init` to prepare a repo for Codex on the first run, so a new
  user starting Codex can immediately use Cadence commands without manually
  discovering extra adapter setup steps.
  - `cadence init --host codex` (with `--agents-md`) now wires host hooks,
    generates the project-level `AGENTS.md` guidance, and flows through the
    same init path as Claude Code — previously Codex setup only installed
    adapter hooks/prompts and skipped `AGENTS.md` generation.
  - `cadence doctor` gained Codex readiness checks (hooks, prompts,
    `AGENTS.md`, global command availability), each with an opt-in `doctor
--fix` remediation.
  - Codex/quickstart/CLI docs point first-time users at `cadence init --host
codex` instead of adapter-only setup.

- d502562: Harden handoff/resume against two gaps ground-truth discovery didn't cover:
  a handoff that's stale relative to origin, and a handoff whose narrative was
  never finished.
  - `cadence resume` now runs a best-effort origin-freshness probe before
    replaying a doc (config `resume.remoteCheck`, default `true`; `--offline`
    to skip) and warns when origin has commits this clone lacks, since a
    stale handoff can be superseded by work pushed from another machine.
  - `cadence resume` and `cadence handoff --check` (new) both detect
    scaffolded `<!-- … FILL IN … -->` sections left unfilled by a prior
    session and flag them — `resume` as a warning, `handoff --check` as an
    exit-3 completion gate.
  - `cadence handoff --no-fetch` skips the pre-facts `git fetch` for a fully
    offline write; `git-facts` records whether the fetch actually ran.
  - The Claude Code `/cadence-handoff` and `/cadence-resume` slash-command
    guidance text is updated to teach agents the new gate and banner.

- 1351044: Add `host-cli`, a 4th verifier provider that shells out to your already-authenticated `claude`/`codex` CLI in headless mode instead of requiring a separate `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
  - New provider value `'host-cli'` on every provider config slice (`verifier`, `perTaskVerifier`, `codeReview`, `planReview`, `securityAudit`, `specReview`), plus `cadence activate --provider host-cli` and `cadence settle run --verifier host-cli`. Binary discovery defaults to `claude` on PATH, overridable via `CADENCE_HOST_CLI_BIN`.
  - If the configured binary is missing or the CLI reports an auth/exit failure, verification for that call transparently falls back to `mock` with a loud stderr warning — never silent, never a hang waiting on interactive auth.
  - **Current scope**: only the per-task-verify family (the BUILD-phase task verifier) has a real `host-cli`-backed implementation in this release. The other verifier families (deep-verify, code-review, spec-review, plan-review, security-audit) accept the config value but currently fall back to mock with a warning until they're wired in a follow-up. `cadence doctor`/`cadence activate` report `host-cli` readiness from config well-formedness alone (no required credential, by design) — not a live probe of the binary; that's only discovered lazily on the first real verification call. See `docs/providers.md` for the full picture, including a known no-spawn-timeout gap.
  - The JSON-extraction + schema-repair-retry logic previously private to the `local` provider is now a shared, transport-agnostic module (`json-repair.ts`) reused by both `local` and `host-cli`.

- bef364d: Make verifier activation trustworthy: broader key discovery, a real
  activation smoke test, and committed provider config that actually reaches
  every real call site.
  - A verifier API key is now discovered from a `.env` file at the repo root
    when it isn't exported into the process environment (`discoverKey`),
    closing the gap where a legitimately-available key was invisible to
    `cadence activate`/`cadence doctor` unless manually `export`ed.
  - `cadence activate`'s live provider check is no longer coincidentally
    skippable — when a key is discovered and the provider isn't `mock`, the
    smoke test runs and its outcome (not mere key presence) gates whether
    activation is reported as successful. `--no-check` remains the only
    explicit opt-out.
  - The discovered-key path now reaches every real verifier-selection call
    site (`cadence doctor`, `cadence settle run`'s deep-verify/code-review/
    security-audit seams, the draft/build gates, `cadence spec approve`), not
    just the primitives — including `cadence mcp serve --repo <path>`, where
    the server process's own working directory can differ from the repo being
    operated on. A teammate who never ran `cadence activate` locally, but
    whose key is discoverable and whose repo already commits a real provider
    choice, now gets real verification instead of a silent mock fallback.

## 1.42.0

### Minor Changes

- Add `boundaryEnforcement: 'warn' | 'block'` (default `warn`, back-compat), overridable per-phase via DRAFT frontmatter. In `block` mode, `handlePreToolEdit` refuses an out-of-boundary edit at edit time instead of only warning. Fails open (never blocks) when there's no active draft/phase, or when the active draft declares zero `files:` in total.
- Add a `boundary-scan` settle gate — closes the blind spot edit-time `boundaryEnforcement: 'block'` can't see (most notably a subagent-driven edit, invisible to the pre-tool-edit hook). Enumerates every file touched by the whole phase via an unscoped git diff against the integration ref, and refuses settle on a real out-of-boundary offender when `boundaryEnforcement` resolves to `block` — bypassable via `--force`/`--allow-boundary-scan-failure` unless the gate is sealed.
- Catch a subagent (or a human) touching a DRAFT task's declared files after that task is already marked `DONE`/`DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` — live at edit time via a new `redundantWorkEnforcement: 'off' | 'warn' | 'block'` config (default `warn`, DRAFT-frontmatter overridable), plus a `SubagentStart` baseline snapshot + advisory task-board nudge and a `SubagentStop` safety net that diffs an agent's touched files against its baseline.
- Add `cadence dispatch plan [--json]`, a read-only CLI command that computes wave-based subagent dispatch groups from the active BUILD draft's task list (a unified topological-leveling pass over `depends:` edges and `files:`-overlap prerequisite edges, plus cycle/unknown-dependency detection), and a new `/cadence-dispatch` Claude Code slash command that drives the host agent through a parallel Task-tool dispatch loop over the computed waves. `Task` gains an optional `depends: string[]` DRAFT.md field.

### Patch Changes

- Fix `parseSpecMd`/`parseDraftMd` silently truncating a multi-line Objective or a multi-line Given/When/Then clause at the first line break. Both extractors now capture the full wrapped text; single-line parsing is byte-identical to before.

## 1.41.0

### Minor Changes

- Add three MCP tools closing the scout-to-phase dead-end for MCP-only clients:
  `cadence_recommendation_convert`, `cadence_milestone_propose`, and
  `cadence_recommendation_archive`, each a thin wrapper over the existing
  service/store functions. Also expose a per-phase `SUMMARY.json` resource
  (`cadence://phase/{phase}/summary.json`), and fix
  `cadence_recommendation_promote`'s description, which pointed at a CLI-only
  `milestone propose` command an MCP client has no way to invoke.

  - @manehorizons/cadence-types@1.41.0

## 1.40.0

### Minor Changes

- Add `cadence draft set-objective`/`add-ac`/`add-task`: three additive
  subcommands that mutate a PENDING `DRAFT.md`'s Objective, Acceptance
  Criteria, and Tasks sections directly, round-tripping through the existing
  `parseDraftMd` parser so a hand-typed heading typo can no longer silently
  corrupt AC/Task id sequencing. Hand-editing `DRAFT.md` remains fully
  supported. Also fixes a `parseAcceptanceCriteria`/`parseTasks` heading-regex
  bug found via the new round-trip tests where a name-less `### AC-N:` heading
  bled the next line into the parsed name.

- Updated dependencies

## 1.39.0

### Minor Changes

- Two additive features land together in this release:
  - **`settle-pending` recommendation status** (issue #126, part 1/3): when a
    `converted` recommendation's phase settles, it now moves to a new
    non-terminal `settle-pending` status (visible in the active ledger, not
    archived) instead of the old behavior of silently archiving it. A new
    `cadence doctor` `recommendation-shipped-drift` check and an optional
    `cadence progress` `Note:` line surface recommendations awaiting ship
    confirmation (`recommendation promote --status=shipped`).
  - **`/cadence-recommend` slash command + `cadence recommend --top <n>`**: caps
    the displayed ranked recommendation list to the top N entries (totals still
    report the full count).

  `cadence-types` carries the `settle-pending` schema addition; `cadence-core`
  carries both features' logic; the two host adapters are version-alignment
  only (prompt-catalog parity, no functional change).

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @manehorizons/cadence-core@1.39.0
  - @manehorizons/cadence-types@1.39.0

## 1.38.0

### Minor Changes

- Cross-worktree handoff discovery for `cadence resume` (v1.38 milestone,
  phases 142-144). `cadence resume` now discovers resumable handoff docs
  across all active git worktrees of a repo, not just the current checkout's
  own `.cadence/handoff/` — a live `git worktree list` scan, no cached index.

  Bare `cadence resume` still resumes the local candidate by default; when 2+
  worktrees have resumable handoffs it additionally prints a one-line stderr
  nudge pointing at `--list` (a new `resume.autoList` config field switches
  this to an auto-opening interactive picker instead). New CLI flags —
  `--list`, `--pick <n>`, `--path <p>`, `--local` — surface the full candidate
  set and let you resolve directly to any of them. Picking a sibling
  worktree's candidate is strictly read-only: it never writes into that
  worktree's `.cadence/` and never stamps the local `state.session.lastHandoff`.

  `cadence-core` carries the feature; `cadence-types` carries the additive
  `HandoffCandidate`/`ResumeResult` schema fields and the new `resume` config
  block; both host adapters get a slash-command guidance update (prompt-parity
  only, no functional change).

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @manehorizons/cadence-core@1.38.0
  - @manehorizons/cadence-types@1.38.0

## 1.37.0

### Minor Changes

- Close the gap between what `cadence tutorial` demonstrates (real enforcement)
  and what a fresh `cadence init` delivers: `verification.coverageMode` now
  defaults to `assertion` for new inits across all three presets (a comment-only
  `AC-N` mention no longer counts as tested; existing `config.json` files are
  untouched), `verification.testCommand` is derived from the target repo's
  `package.json#scripts.test` + detected package manager and wired into both the
  real init write path and `init --dry-run`'s preview, and `build-test-must-pass`
  now writes a loud, non-blocking notice to stderr when no test command is
  configured instead of passing silently.
- Make a settle's PASS verdicts auditable instead of opaque: `SUMMARY.json`
  now records per-gate `ran`/`skipped` (+ reason) provenance for every
  settle-dispatched gate, and each `acResults[]` row carries an optional
  `evidence` class (`ai-verified`, `executed`, `assertion`, `mention`, or
  `unverified`) — the strongest real evidence found for that AC. A
  mock-provider deep-verify never reports `ai-verified` evidence. `SUMMARY.md`
  renders a new "Gate provenance" section plus an evidence tag next to each AC
  line. Pre-existing SUMMARY records without these fields still parse and
  render unchanged.

## 1.36.0

### Minor Changes

- Onboarding-honesty wave 1: six small, high-trust fixes from the 2026-07-01
  audit (phases 133–138).
  - `cadence doctor`'s git-hooks check now verifies `.githooks/` actually exists
    before flagging, and never auto-overwrites a pre-existing custom
    `hooksPath` (e.g. Husky) (phase 133).
  - `cadence progress --json` — mirrors `recommend --json`'s pattern (phase 134).
  - `init --demo` no longer prints the generic "Your first loop"/"Hand it to
    your AI agent" blocks (which immediately refuse in DRAFT) alongside the
    correct demo instructions (phase 135).
  - README's real-phase walkthrough gets an inline `--no-approve` pointer at
    the approve line (phase 136).
  - Refusal trio: BUILD-state `progress` names the real first-pending task (or
    `settle run --auto`) instead of an unrunnable compound command;
    `draft approve` on a missing `DRAFT.md` gives a clean guarded refusal
    instead of a raw `ENOENT`; out-of-position `settle run` also prints a
    `Next:` line (phase 137).
  - Slash-command count reconciled to the code-true count across
    README/quickstart/claude-code.md (fixed a broken TOC anchor), and
    `cadence start`'s menu gained an `activate` option (phase 138).

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @manehorizons/cadence-core@1.36.0
  - @manehorizons/cadence-types@1.36.0

## 1.35.0

### Minor Changes

- Add `cadence init --dry-run`: a non-destructive fit-check that resolves
  everything init would (project name, gate profile, layout, test globs,
  verification/provider status, host surface, and the exact files it would
  create) and prints a preview without touching the repo. Honors the resolution
  flags (`--gate-profile`, `--activate`, `--demo`), and previews rather than
  refuses on an already-initialized repo (a real init still exits 2). Powered by
  a pure `planInit`/`renderInitPlan` seam; the real write path is unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @manehorizons/cadence-core@1.35.0
  - @manehorizons/cadence-types@1.35.0

## 1.34.0

### Minor Changes

- e8101b8: Add `cadence doctor --fix`: apply safe, deterministic repairs for the fixable
  doctor findings (git-hooks → `core.hooksPath=.githooks`; regenerate a missing
  `STATE.md`), with a `--wire-host` opt-in that re-runs the Claude Code host
  install for host findings and a `--dry-run` preview that writes nothing. Risky
  findings stay manual guidance. Non-interactive and agent/non-TTY-safe.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [e8101b8]
  - @manehorizons/cadence-core@1.34.0
  - @manehorizons/cadence-types@1.34.0

## 1.33.0

### Minor Changes

- 689249b: Add `cadence agent-prompt` and an `init` output block that hand the user a
  copy-paste prompt to scaffold the first real CADENCE phase with an AI agent
  (testable ACs, stop at approval). Host-agnostic; pure render shared by both
  surfaces.

- Updated dependencies [689249b]
  - @manehorizons/cadence-core@1.33.0
  - @manehorizons/cadence-types@1.33.0

## 1.32.0

### Minor Changes

- fae3d3e: Rebuild `cadence tutorial` around the catch (refuse → fix → pass)

  The tutorial now stages a lie and lets settle catch it. In a throwaway sandbox it
  drives draft → approve → build, marks task `T1` DONE with a real `sum.mjs` but no
  test, and runs `cadence settle run --auto` — which **refuses**: the `test-coverage`
  gate names `AC-1` and the loop stays open. The tutorial then writes a real
  `sum.test.mjs`; the second `settle run --auto` executes it through
  `build-test-must-pass` (`node --test`, real exit code) and the loop closes with a
  SUMMARY. The previous `--ac AC-1=pass` manual assertion and `allowMissingCoverage`
  bypass are gone — the gates decide on real state alone, so the refusal a newcomer
  needs to see is now the demo's centerpiece. No engine changes; `cadence init --demo`
  and `renderDemoDraft` are untouched. `cadence-core` carries the feature; the other
  three published packages are version-alignment only.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [fae3d3e]
  - @manehorizons/cadence-core@1.32.0
  - @manehorizons/cadence-types@1.32.0

## 1.31.0

### Minor Changes

- 94ade49: Add first-real-task DRAFT templates for `cadence draft new --template`.

  `bugfix`, `feature`, and `refactor` templates now generate editable Objective,
  Acceptance Criteria, Tasks, and Boundaries sections from the supplied title,
  while preserving the legacy scaffold whenever `--template` is omitted. The
  template path works with auto-derived phase ids and explicit phase/task ids, and
  unknown template names refuse before writing a DRAFT.

  The README, quickstart, CLI guide, and command reference now show template
  commands as the first-real-DRAFT path after tutorial/demo onboarding. The host
  adapter and types packages carry version-alignment bumps only.

- Updated dependencies [94ade49]
- Updated dependencies [5ab7814]

## 1.30.0

### Minor Changes

- Release v1.30.0: adoption-onboarding ergonomics, settle bypass audit trails, and Codex host parity.
  - `cadence draft new --title "..."` can now derive the next free phase id and task number, making the recommended first-loop command shorter and less error-prone.
  - `cadence settle run` now records and prints explicit gate bypass audit entries for force, coverage, and verifier-failure paths, and SUMMARY artifacts expose those bypasses through the shared summary schema.
  - Codex host prompts now source shared command guidance, install the `cadence-scout` prompt, and carry parity coverage for local hook roundtrips and prompt-catalog drift.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @manehorizons/cadence-core@1.30.0
  - @manehorizons/cadence-types@1.30.0

## 1.29.0

### Minor Changes

- Non-TTY auto-bypass for the approve + interactive-verdict gates (phase 116, rec-20260617-005).

  The two interactive loop gates no longer hard-fail in a non-TTY with `StdinPrompter: stdin is not a TTY`. A pure `resolveInteractivity(env, isTTY)` seam drives both: the `approve` gate auto-passes loudly (stderr audit trail), and the `interactive-verdict` gate skips its per-AC walker, passes, and records `interactiveVerifySkipped: "non-tty"` in the SUMMARY — no human verdicts are fabricated, and the other verification gates still decide. Three env controls: `CADENCE_REQUIRE_TTY=1` restores the strict refusal, `CADENCE_NONINTERACTIVE=1` forces bypass under a pseudo-TTY, and a supplied `CADENCE_PROMPTER_SCRIPT` is always honored. Env-driven only — no config knob.

  `cadence-core` carries the feature; `cadence-types` carries the `interactiveVerifySkipped` summary field; the two host adapters are version-alignment only.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @manehorizons/cadence-core@1.29.0
  - @manehorizons/cadence-types@1.29.0

## 1.28.0

### Minor Changes

- 401d86c: Coverage-gate assertion mode (phase 108): an opt-in
  `verification.coverageMode` that closes the test-coverage gate's
  "mentioned-but-not-tested" false positive. The default `mention` mode is
  unchanged — any occurrence of an `AC-N` token anywhere in a matched test file
  (comments included) counts as covered.
  - `verification.coverageMode: "assertion"` counts an `AC-N` token only when it
    sits inside an asserting `it()`/`test()` block. A comment-only or
    assertion-less mention is reported as a **weak link**: the gate refuses with a
    distinct "not inside an asserting it()/test() block" hint, separate from the
    plain "has no linked test" message for an entirely-absent AC, and the refusal
    names the mode.
  - Span detection is a pure, dependency-free, string/comment-aware scan
    (`findTestSpans`) — no AST, no new dependency, no network; deterministic and
    offline. Parens inside a title string don't break it.
  - Editable via `cadence config edit coverageMode`; documented in
    `docs/reference/config.md` and `docs/concepts.md`.

  Backward-compatible: a config with no `verification.coverageMode` loads as
  `mention` and behaves byte-for-byte as before. `cadence-types` carries the new
  schema field; `host-claude-code` / `host-codex` carry version-alignment bumps
  only.

- 3fae956: Onboarding front door + guided Next: rail (phase 113): make `cadence start` the
  single, unambiguous onboarding entry point, with `cadence quickstart` reframed
  as the post-init "where am I / what's next" map.
  - README leads with `cadence start` alone (the co-equal "or quickstart" framing
    is gone; quickstart is now described as the post-init map).
  - `cadence doctor` ends with a `Next:` line — the first problem's remediation
    when any check is non-ok, else `cadence progress` — so doctor joins the same
    guided rail as the other onboarding commands. (`--json` output unchanged.)
  - `docs/quickstart.md` opens with a 3-way driver fork (terminal / Claude Code /
    MCP) so host users branch immediately.

  Copy/UX only except the small `doctor` Next: line; v1.27's
  `init`/`--demo`/`--activate` flows are untouched, and `quickstart` keeps its
  never-throw guarantee. `cadence-types` / the two host adapters carry
  version-alignment bumps only.

- f6182c0: Onboarding papercuts (phase 114): two small fixes.
  - `cadence init` now prints a one-line heads-up when a young repo gets the
    `auto` gate profile from the git-history suggestion — warning that
    `draft approve` will flip to interactive once the repo passes ~20 commits, and
    that pinning `--gate-profile auto` keeps it hands-off. Only fires for derived
    `auto` (not when pinned explicitly, nor for `standard`/`strict`).
    (rec-20260617-009, scoped down — the preset/profile terminology already
    carries inline clarifiers.)
  - `cadence handoff` honors a `CADENCE_NOW` env override (a date string) for the
    SESSION-doc date, via a pure `resolveNow(env)` seam — making handoff runs
    reproducible and closing a UTC-midnight flake in the clobber-refusal test
    (two runs straddling midnight got different dates and never collided). No
    behavior change when unset. (rec-20260618-001.)

  `cadence-types` / the two host adapters carry version-alignment bumps only.

## 1.27.0

### Minor Changes

- v1.27.0 — onboarding breeze: make `cadence init` a zero-friction front door.
  - **Zero-prompt init** (phase 108): `cadence init` derives the project name
    (`package.json#name`, scope-stripped, else the directory name) and the gate
    profile (git-history heuristic) — it asks nothing.
  - **Auto-wire the host** (phase 108): when a `.claude/` workspace is present,
    `--wire-host` runs the Claude Code adapter install in the same step via a
    subprocess spawn (core never imports host code); a TTY offers it, non-TTY
    skips with a pointer. `--skip-host-wire` opts out.
  - **`init --demo`** (phase 109): seed a ready-to-approve demo phase (objective +
    AC-1 + T1, shared with the `tutorial` toy template) so a newcomer runs a full
    `approve → done → settle` loop in their own repo with no hand-edit.
  - **`init --activate`** (phase 110): when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is present, turn on
    real verification (`verifier.provider=anthropic`, deep-verify seam) in the same
    step via the shared activate seam — the key is never persisted, and no live
    check runs (that stays in `cadence activate`).

  `cadence-types`, `cadence-host-claude-code`, and `cadence-host-codex` carry
  version-alignment bumps only (the feature lands in `cadence-core`).

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @manehorizons/cadence-core@1.27.0
  - @manehorizons/cadence-types@1.27.0

## 1.26.0

### Minor Changes

- Add `cadence start`, an interactive onboarding front door: "What are you doing?"
  → numbered pick → confirm → runs the matching setup command (tutorial, init,
  Claude Code / Codex host install, MCP install, or doctor). Sibling to the
  read-only `cadence quickstart`. Dispatch is a uniform subprocess spawn (the
  `cadence` binary for core routes, `npx` for the two host packages). Scriptable
  via `--pick`/`--yes`/`--json`; a non-interactive shell prints the menu and exits 0.

  cadence-core carries the feature; the other three are version-alignment bumps.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @manehorizons/cadence-core@1.26.0
  - @manehorizons/cadence-types@1.26.0

## 1.25.0

### Minor Changes

- v1.25.0 — real-verification-default: name mock honestly as a placeholder

  The `mock` verifier is now explicitly named a non-verifier placeholder across
  every surface, closing the gap between the "real verification gate" pitch and
  the out-of-box mock default (the #1 finding of the 2026-06-11 competitive
  assessment; rec-20260611-003).

  A single source-of-truth `MOCK_VERIFIER_NOTICE` constant in `cadence-types`
  feeds: the settle mock-fallback banner, the `cadence doctor`
  verification-readiness check, `cadence init`'s new "Turn on real verification"
  block, the `cadence quickstart` / `config explain` all-mock warning, and the
  docs (README, concepts, providers, config). Warning-only — mock stays the
  zero-config offline default; nothing is blocked. `cadence-types` carries the
  new constant; the host adapters carry version-alignment bumps only.

## 1.24.0

### Minor Changes

- 9d6684e: Recommendation retention (v1.24): manual + automatic soft-archival of
  recommendations. Terminal recs already drop out of the active `cadence recommend`
  surface but the ledger was append-only — v1.24 adds recoverable move-aside archival.
  - `cadence recommendation archive <id>` / `unarchive <id>` and `recommendation list
--archived` — manual soft-archive (moves a rec into the ledger's new `archived`
    array; recoverable, never deleted; `recommendation show` is archive-aware).
  - `recommendations.autoArchive` config (default **on**, recoverable): a rec is
    auto-archived when it goes terminal — `shipped`/`rejected` immediately on `promote`,
    and a `converted` rec when its phase completes SETTLE (best-effort, never blocks
    settle). Set `false` to keep terminal recs in the active ledger.

  Backward-compatible: a pre-v1.24 `recommendations.json` (no `archived` key) loads
  unchanged. `host-claude-code` / `host-codex` carry version-alignment bumps only.

  - @manehorizons/cadence-core@1.24.0

## 1.23.0

### Minor Changes

- 14aadd0: Add a `shipped` terminal status to the recommendation lifecycle (phase 100,
  from rec-20260611-001). A rec whose work has landed — directly via a PR, or
  after a formal `convert` — can now reach a truthful positive-terminal state via
  `cadence recommendation promote <id> --status=shipped [--ref "PR #70 / v1.22.1"]`,
  instead of being stuck at `candidate`. `shipped` recs drop out of the active
  `cadence recommend` surface (like `converted`/`rejected`); the optional freeform
  `shippedRef` is rendered as a `- shipped:` provenance line. The one sanctioned
  transition out of an otherwise-terminal status is `converted → shipped`.

## 1.22.1

### Patch Changes

- 9a23c60: Fix the phase-id ceiling (rec-20260610-001): widen the id schema from
  `^\d{2}-\d{2}$` to `^\d{2,}-\d{2,}$` and derive ids through a single
  `derivePhaseTaskId` helper, so phases >= 100 are representable end-to-end
  instead of being mangled into `10-100`. Existing 01-99 ids are unchanged.
- Updated dependencies [9a23c60]
  - @manehorizons/cadence-core@1.22.1
  - @manehorizons/cadence-types@1.22.1

## 1.22.0

### Minor Changes

- Verification-activation (v1.22.0): `cadence activate` — a guided command that takes
  a project from all-mock verifiers to one real-verification loop.
  - **`cadence activate`** picks a provider and writes `verifier.provider` (the
    deep-verify seam by default; `--all` sets every seam), validates the key with a
    minimal live anthropic ping (`--no-check` to skip; `local`/`mock` skip the ping),
    and never persists the key — only the provider name is written. Key-missing still
    records the selection and prints the exact `export …` line (set-up-now-key-later);
    a failed live check exits non-zero without losing the selection. `--print` previews
    the plan without writing; non-interactive runs require `--provider`.
  - **`cadence doctor`** gains a `verification-readiness` check (reusing the same pure
    readiness assessment): `warning` on all-mock (remedy: `cadence activate`) or a real
    provider missing its key; `ok` otherwise; best-effort, never throws.
  - **Discoverability:** `cadence quickstart`, `cadence config explain` (a new
    `all-mock` warning), and `cadence init` now point at `cadence activate`.

  `cadence-host-claude-code` and `cadence-host-codex` carry version-alignment bumps
  only (no functional change).

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies

## 1.21.0

### Minor Changes

- Quickstart-onboarding milestone (v1.21.0): a four-slice arc that lowers the
  barrier to a first CADENCE loop and makes config self-explanatory.
  - **Slice A — `cadence config explain`**: terminal-sized, in-CLI explanation of
    the _active_ config in plain language — resolved gates, providers, and
    warnings — so operators don't have to cross-reference `docs/reference/config.md`.
  - **Slice B — deepen `config explain`**: richer per-field guidance and an
    optional `[field]` focus, extending the embedded help so it works from any
    install.
  - **Slice C — `cadence config edit`**: a guided edit wizard that writes
    validated changes back to `.cadence/config.json` without hand-editing JSON.
  - **Slice D — `cadence quickstart`**: a state-aware onboarding front door that
    orients a new user from any loop position (uninitialized, IDLE, mid-phase),
    reusing `nextAction`; never throws, with a corrupt-state fallback and `--json`.

  `cadence-host-claude-code` and `cadence-host-codex` carry version-alignment bumps
  only (no functional change).

## 1.20.0

### Minor Changes

- Handoff retention (v1.20): opt-in, count-based pruning of dated `SESSION-*.md`
  handoff docs. A new `handoff.retain` config field keeps the N most-recent
  session handoffs and hard-deletes the rest at handoff-write time
  (deterministic, offline, best-effort — never fails a handoff, never silently
  destroys the dated archive `resume` relies on). Unset = no pruning (current
  behavior). A read-only `cadence doctor` `handoff-retention` check makes
  unmanaged accumulation visible. `host-claude-code`/`host-codex` carry
  version-alignment bumps only.

## 1.19.0

### Minor Changes

- v1.19 worktree-safety polish: surface cross-worktree phase usage proactively on the v1.18
  collision primitive. `cadence doctor` gains a read-only `worktree-phases` check (warns when a
  sibling worktree claims a local phase number, naming the conflict + next free number; best-effort,
  sibling-vs-local only), and the IDLE `cadence draft new …` suggestion in `progress`/`recommend`
  now fills in the next free number (`max(observed)+1` over local + sibling + upstream) instead of a
  bare placeholder, so the first pick clears claims the guard would refuse. Lowest-gap numbering was
  evaluated and dropped — `nextFree` stays monotonic `max+1`. `cadence-types`,
  `cadence-host-claude-code`, and `cadence-host-codex` carry version-alignment bumps only.

## 1.18.0

### Minor Changes

- v1.18 — worktree-safety: phase-collision guard.

  CADENCE's loop state lives in the working tree and each git worktree holds a private `.cadence/`, so
  two worktrees branched from the same commit can both scaffold "phase N" — and with different slugs
  git silently merges both in. The new phase-collision guard observes ground truth (`git worktree list`
  - `origin/<integrationRef>`) and refuses to scaffold a phase number already claimed by a sibling
    worktree or upstream, naming the conflict and suggesting the next free number, so the collision fails
    loud before wasted work.
  * Fires at scaffold time (`cadence spec new` / `cadence draft new`) and as a `cadence settle run`
    backstop. `--allow-phase-collision` bypasses per run (never bypasses the local same-dir refusal).
  * New `phaseGuard { enabled (default true), integrationRef (default "main") }` config block.
  * Best-effort: a non-git / offline / single-worktree checkout behaves exactly as before — the only
    hard failure is an actual detected collision.

  `cadence-types` adds the `phaseGuard` schema; `cadence-host-claude-code` and `cadence-host-codex`
  carry version-alignment bumps only (no functional change).

## 1.17.0

### Minor Changes

- Observability: structured operator-debugging logger (v1.17)

  Add a zero-dependency, additive, default-off structured logger for diagnosing CADENCE itself.
  Writes only to stderr (never stdout — safe for `--json` and the `cadence mcp serve` protocol
  channel), gated by `CADENCE_LOG_LEVEL`/`CADENCE_LOG_FORMAT` env vars and an optional
  `config.logging { level, format }` block (precedence env > config > default `silent`).

  Three seams are instrumented via context-bound child loggers: `gate` (settle gate
  skipped/passed/refused decisions), `hook` (host lifecycle event dispatch), and `verify` (AI
  verifier provider request/response/error, including token usage). Verifier auth headers and API
  keys are never logged. `cadence-types` gains the pure `LogLevel`/`LogFormat`/`LogRecord` types;
  `cadence-host-*` carry version-alignment bumps only (no functional change).

## 1.16.0

### Minor Changes

- MCP surface deepening (v1.16.0): grow the `cadence mcp serve` surface from a
  thin tools-only slice into a full MCP integration, along four dimensions.
  - **Resources (phase 75).** `.cadence/` artifacts are exposed read-on-demand
    under a `cadence://` scheme — `state`, `state.json`, `roadmap`, `project`,
    `recommendations`, plus templated `phase/{phase}/draft|summary`. No
    subscriptions / file-watching; readers reuse the same bytes the CLI reads.
  - **Tool parity (phase 76).** Five proven-out commands join the tool set:
    `cadence_handoff`, `cadence_resume`, `cadence_recommendation_add`,
    `cadence_recommendation_promote`, `cadence_doctor` — enabling session
    continuity and the full scout → rec → promote path over MCP (15 tools total).
  - **Prompts + shared guidance (phase 77).** The canonical command guidance and
    the `cadence-scout` dialogue move into a shared `cadence-types` module
    (`COMMAND_GUIDANCE` + `SCOUT_DIALOGUE`) — one source of truth for both the
    Claude Code slash commands (rendered output byte-identical) and the new MCP
    prompts (`cadence_scout`, `cadence_next`, `cadence_draft`, `cadence_settle`).
  - **Zero-config (phase 78).** New `cadence mcp install [--print] [--client <c>]`
    non-destructively writes/merges a project `.mcp.json` (idempotent; refuses to
    clobber a malformed file); `--print` emits a snippet for other hosts.

  `cadence-types` carries the shared guidance module; `cadence-host-claude-code`
  re-sources its slash-command prose from it (byte-identical); `cadence-host-codex`
  carries a version-alignment bump only. stdio-only and imperative-surface-only
  still hold — ambient edit-time gates remain host-hook-only (DESIGN.md D11,
  deepened additively, no new D-number).

## 1.15.0

### Minor Changes

- f501588: Verifier robustness (v1.15.0): make the real verifier providers dependable in a
  settle gate, let the operator pick one at the command line, and make every
  verifier run's token usage auditable. Provider hardening + ergonomics around
  unchanged verdict logic — not a verifier rewrite.
  - **Provider hardening (Phase 72).** `anthropic` gains configurable
    `verifier.timeoutMs` + `verifier.maxRetries` (threaded via a pure
    `buildAnthropicClientConfig` seam), so a transient 429/5xx/network blip in a
    settle gate retries before failing loud. `local` gains auth: a bearer
    `Authorization` header from `CADENCE_LOCAL_API_KEY` plus arbitrary
    `verifier.localHeaders`, so token-gated OpenAI-compatible proxies work. Header
    values are never logged. Three new backward-compatible `verifier.*` config
    fields.
  - **Verifier selection + cost visibility (Phase 73).** `cadence settle run
--verifier <mock|anthropic|local>` overrides the config-only provider
    selection (precedence flag > config > default `mock`; invalid values rejected
    at parse time). The override flows into the v1.14 mock-fallback banner so it
    reflects the effective provider. `VerifyResult` and the SUMMARY's
    `deepVerifyMeta` gain optional token usage (`inputTokens` / `outputTokens`),
    captured from Anthropic's `usage` and from `local` endpoints that return one.
    Dollar cost is not derived (no price table to rot).

  `cadence-types`, `cadence-host-claude-code`, and `cadence-host-codex` carry
  version-alignment bumps only (the token-usage field on `deepVerifyMeta` lives in
  `cadence-types`; the host adapters are unchanged).

## 1.14.0

### Minor Changes

- b8861dc: Verifier correctness (v1.14.0): the `deep-verify` gate now sends the AI verifier
  the actual phase diff instead of an empty string, so deep verification judges the
  implementation rather than test-linkage alone.
  - `deep-verify` wires the memoized `git diff HEAD` (shared with `code-review`) into
    the verifier input, bounded by the new `verifier.diffCapBytes` config (default
    256KB) and truncated with an explicit `[diff truncated: N of M bytes]` marker.
  - A run-level `deepVerifyMeta` provenance record (`diffProvided`, `diffBytes`,
    `truncated`, `filesCount`, `provider`, `model`) is written to the SUMMARY so a
    verdict is auditable.
  - The mock-fallback banner now fires whenever the gate runs in mock — on `--deep`
    **or** gate-set membership (e.g. `standard × complex`) — so a settle never runs
    mock verification silently.

  `cadence-host-claude-code` and `cadence-host-codex` carry version-alignment bumps
  only (no functional change).

## 1.13.0

### Minor Changes

- **Multi-host reach: the OpenAI Codex adapter** — a new published package
  `@manehorizons/cadence-host-codex`, the second consumer of the phase-60
  host-adapter contract (`ADAPTER_CONTRACT_VERSION = 1`, unchanged). It proves the
  contract is not Claude-Code-shaped: a genuinely differently-shaped host conforms
  without a contract bump.
  - `codexAdapter satisfies HostAdapter`: capabilities, `mapEvent` (Codex's
    near-1:1 lifecycle → cadence abstract events), and `extractPayload` parsing
    Codex's multi-file `apply_patch` envelope into `ExtractedPayload.files`.
  - `cadence-host-codex install`: project-level `.codex/hooks.json` + global
    `$CODEX_HOME/prompts/cadence-*.md` slash-command prompts (with a global-scope
    warning), `--local`/`CODEX_HOME` aware.
  - `cadence-host-codex hook`: the runtime shim — translates Codex stdin-JSON and
    spawns the core dispatcher; proven end-to-end against real loop state.

  `cadence-core`, `cadence-types`, and `cadence-host-claude-code` carry
  version-alignment bumps to stay in lockstep; no functional change.
