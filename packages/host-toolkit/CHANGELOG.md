## 1.67.0

### Minor Changes

- d8d19ad: Fix: `cadence doctor`'s `host-hooks` check now verifies that every managed hook entry the Claude Code installer writes is actually present — completeness, not just marker existence. It previously passed as soon as any single non-stale `_managedBy: "cadence"` entry existed anywhere in `.claude/settings.json`, which let a genuinely partial install (missing the `PostToolUse` `Skill`-tool matcher, or the entire `SubagentStart` event) report `ok` indefinitely. That gap was measured live in this repo: `state.skillAudit.invoked` never populated because the `Skill`-tool hook never fired, and `runSkillAuditCheck` would hard-refuse any settle declaring a required skill — with `doctor` reporting everything healthy throughout (see phase 294, `rec-20260823-005`).

  `host-hooks` now reports `error` (escalated from `warning`) when one or more expected managed entries are missing, naming every gap specifically — not just the first. A managed entry that is present but references a stale, pre-rename npm scope is unaffected by this change and still reports `warning`, as before.

  The expected hook set is a single source of truth in `@thomas-powers-jr/cadence-host-toolkit` (`CLAUDE_CODE_EXPECTED_HOOKS`), which `install.ts` now builds its installed shape from directly. `@thomas-powers-jr/cadence-core` cannot import host-adapter packages, so it holds its own independent copy for the doctor check; a dedicated test in `@thomas-powers-jr/cadence-host-claude-code` (which depends on both) pins the two against each other so they cannot silently drift apart.

  `checkCodexHooks` (`.codex/hooks.json`) has the identical existence-only gap and is deliberately left unfixed in this change — Codex's expected hook shape differs genuinely (different event names, `apply_patch` matcher) and is out of scope here; the gap is filed as `rec-20260823-006`, its own follow-up recommendation, rather than silently left unaddressed.

  Closes `rec-20260823-005`.

### Minor Changes

- 8b42ff4: Renamed the npm scope to `@thomas-powers-jr` across all five published
  packages, matching the GitHub org rename in #360. This is a rename of
  existing software on its existing 1.x version lineage, not a new product —
  consistent with the standing pre-v2.0.0 semver policy.

  The previously-published packages under the old scope are not deleted —
  they stay resolvable and get `npm deprecate`d with a pointer to the new
  scope, as a separate operator-run step after this release. See
  [docs/migration-npm-scope.md](../docs/migration-npm-scope.md) for the full
  migration path, including the exact `cadence doctor --fix --wire-host`
  command that repairs an existing consumer's host-adapter hook install.

  `cadence doctor`'s host-hooks and `cadence config explain`'s warnings both
  now distinguish a hook entry that's missing entirely from one that's
  present but still pointing at the old scope — previously both cases
  reported the same "not found" message, which was factually wrong for the
  second case.

## 1.52.0

### Minor Changes

- 127a06b: **BREAKING (engine floor): minimum supported Node.js raised from `>=20` to
  `>=22`.** Node 20 reaches its scheduled end-of-life in April 2026, and Phase
  238 retires the Node 20 CI/test leg across the monorepo (see
  `.cadence/phases/238-drop-node20-support/`) — these packages are no longer
  tested against, or guaranteed to work on, Node 20 or 21. Shipped as a minor
  bump rather than major, matching the precedent set by the Zod v3→v4 upgrade
  (`[1.4.0]`): no external adopters are affected at release time, and CADENCE
  is reserving its first major/2.0.0 release for when the full coupling of
  Cadence is complete.

  Every published package's `package.json` now declares
  `"engines": { "node": ">=22" }`. Consumers still on Node 20 or 21 should
  upgrade their Node.js runtime before installing or running any package at
  this version or later — by default, npm and pnpm only _warn_ on an
  `engines` mismatch (this repo does not set `engine-strict`), but CI
  pipelines or environments with `engine-strict` enabled will fail outright,
  and pipelines pinned to Node 20 should bump their Node version to keep
  using the `cadence` CLI, either host adapter, or
  `@manehorizons/cadence-types`.

## 1.51.1

### Patch Changes

- 1f70e66: Extracts the logic host-claude-code and host-codex duplicated into a new
  shared package, `@manehorizons/cadence-host-toolkit`:

  - The hook-event routing algorithm's shape and the slash-command catalog
    (`COMMANDS`) now live in `host-toolkit/src/routing.ts`. Both adapters
    render their slash commands from this one catalog, which fixes a real
    drift bug: host-codex's local copy had silently lost `cadence-dispatch`'s
    `DISPATCH_DIALOGUE` body. Host-codex's own `mapEvent`/`extractPayload`/
    `routeHookEvent` stay local — its `apply_patch`-based extraction is
    genuinely different from host-claude-code's `file_path`-based extraction,
    not just duplicated; only the structurally-identical `RouteResult` type is
    shared.
  - `install.ts`'s managed-marker merge logic and `locate-self.ts` are also
    extracted into the toolkit, with one shared test suite; both adapters'
    own `install.ts`/`locate-self.ts` are now thin wrappers.
  - Core now enforces a new `HostCapabilities.agentIdentification` flag: a
    host that declares it cannot supply `agentId`/`agentType` (Codex, whose
    hook payload shape doesn't document one) causes core to notice loudly on
    stderr instead of silently behaving as if no subagent were involved.
    Codex's CLI now embeds its declared capabilities into the real hook
    payload it sends to `cadence hook`, so the check is live end-to-end, not
    just testable in isolation.

  No CLI-facing behavior, flags, or exit codes changed for either adapter —
  this is an internal dedup/extraction plus one new loud-notice-on-a-capability-
  gap fix, not a rewrite. `HostAdapter`'s public contract is unchanged.
