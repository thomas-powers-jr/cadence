# Roadmap

> Locked direction for **v0.3.0 → v1.0**. Single source of truth for what's left. Each phase below gets its own DRAFT.md under `.cadence/phases/<phase-id>/` when work begins; this file stays at the strategic level.

**Anchor decisions** (set 2026-05-14 in `/superpowers:write-plan` session):

- **v1.0 = feature-complete.** Every gate in DESIGN.md §4.1 fires. The matrix in §4.2 is no longer decorative.
- **Single-host v1.0.** Claude Code only. Codex / Aider / OpenCode are post-v1.0.
- **continuity-runtime stays abstract.** Webhook (Phase 19.1) is the seam. No direct integration.
- **CI-only, no publish automation.** GitHub Actions runs tests on PR. Releases stay hand-cut until v1.x.
- **Cost-tiered milestone breakdown.** v0.4 cheap → v0.5 medium → v0.6 expensive → v0.7 ergonomics → v0.8 CI → v1.0 ceremony.
- **Verifier-agent gates reuse `--deep` shape.** Each new agent gate (code-review, plan-review, security-audit, per-task-verify) gets a `Verifier`-style interface with `mock` + `anthropic` providers. Phase 15 patterns are the template.
- **Manual approve = interactive Y/N.** `cadence draft approve` on strict profile prompts before BUILD transition.
- **Per-task-verify = verifier agent.** Per-task verifier runs on each `cadence build task` outcome (LLM cost; opt-in via gate set).

---

## v0.4.0 — Cheap gates + telemetry truth

**Theme:** Close the no-LLM gaps. Make telemetry mean something. Wire the cheap gates that ship decoratively.

### Phase 23.1 — DRAFT-read mtime gate

**Objective.** DESIGN.md §4.1 lists `draft-read` as a cheap gate; it appears in every cell from `standard × standard` rightward. Today nothing reads the DRAFT.md or records its mtime. Add a state field `state.draftReadAt: ISO8601` recorded when `cadence draft approve` succeeds; `cadence settle run` refuses if the DRAFT.md mtime is newer than `draftReadAt` (the human edited the DRAFT after approving but before settling — read it again). `--allow-stale-draft` bypasses per-invocation.

**Files.**
- `packages/types/src/state.ts` — add `draftReadAt?: string` to `CadenceStateZ`.
- `packages/core/src/cli/commands/draft.ts` — `approve` writes `state.draftReadAt = new Date().toISOString()`.
- `packages/core/src/cli/commands/settle.ts` — gate check + `--allow-stale-draft` flag.
- `packages/core/tests/cli/settle.test.ts` (or new `tests/cli/draft-read-gate.test.ts`).
- DESIGN.md §4.1 — note `draft-read` shipped Phase 23.1.

**ACs.** (1) `draftReadAt` recorded on approve. (2) Settle refuses on mtime-newer-than-draftReadAt. (3) `--allow-stale-draft` bypasses. (4) Gate only fires when `'draft-read' ∈ gateSet.gates`. (5) Backwards-compat: existing state.json without `draftReadAt` treats the gate as never-fired (no refusal).

### Phase 23.2 — coherence-warn anomaly emission

**Objective.** §3.3 enumerates `coherence-warn` as a §3.3 anomaly trigger but `collectAnomalies` doesn't emit one. Wire emission at `cadence draft check` AND `cadence draft approve` per `severity: 'warn'` coherence issue (blockers already refuse; warns flow through). Source field `coherence.check` vs `coherence.approve`.

**Files.**
- `packages/types/src/anomaly.ts` — extend `AnomalyTypeZ` to include `'coherence-warn'`. **Schema breakage acceptable**: legacy log entries are operational state, not durable data.
- `packages/core/src/cli/commands/draft.ts` — emit warn events through `selectNotifier`.
- `packages/core/src/notify/collect.ts` — leave settle-side untouched (no settle-time coherence check today).
- `packages/core/tests/cli/draft-check.test.ts` + `draft-approve.test.ts` — extend with anomaly assertions.
- DESIGN.md §3.3 row for `coherence-warn`.

**ACs.** (1) New `coherence-warn` event type accepted by schema. (2) `draft check` emits one event per warn issue. (3) `draft approve` emits one event per warn issue before transitioning. (4) Gate-aware: `'anomaly-notify' ∉ gateSet.gates` ⇒ no emission. (5) Schema bump documented in CHANGELOG.

### Phase 23.3 — loop-violation anomaly emission

**Objective.** §3.3 enumerates `loop-violation` as an anomaly trigger. `LoopViolationError` is thrown at multiple sites (settle, build/record, draft commands) — none emit. Wire emission in the dispatcher / catch sites with `severity: 'error'`, `source: 'loop'`, `context: { expected, actual }`.

**Files.**
- `packages/types/src/anomaly.ts` — extend `AnomalyTypeZ` to include `'loop-violation'`.
- `packages/core/src/errors.ts` — `LoopViolationError` may grow `expected` + `actual` fields if not already there.
- `packages/core/src/cli/commands/settle.ts` + `build.ts` + `draft.ts` — catch-and-emit at the top-level try/catch where `LoopViolationError` is currently caught.
- New `packages/core/tests/notify/loop-violation.test.ts`.
- DESIGN.md §3.3 row for `loop-violation`.

**ACs.** (1) New `loop-violation` event type accepted by schema. (2) Each catch site emits exactly one event before exiting with code 1. (3) Event carries the `expected` and `actual` loop positions in context. (4) Gate-aware. (5) Existing settle/build/draft refusal exit codes unchanged.

### Phase 23.4 — `skillAudit` wiring + real `tokenUtilization`

**Objective.** `config.telemetry.skillInvocations: true` and `config.telemetry.tokenUtilization: true` both exist as boolean knobs but neither populates anything real. `state.skillAudit.invoked[]` is always empty; `tokenUtilization` increments by `+0.01` per user-prompt event (proxy, not a real signal). Wire both from real signals.

**Files.**
- `packages/types/src/state.ts` — `SkillInvocation` record shape if not already there.
- `packages/core/src/hooks/handlers.ts` — `handleUserPrompt` reads tool invocations from `ctx.raw` and appends to `state.skillAudit.invoked[]` when the tool name matches a known cadence skill set (or a configurable matcher). `tokenUtilization` switches to a heuristic that reads the actual token count from `ctx.raw` if the host provides it (Claude Code does in some hook payloads); falls back to the existing `+0.01` proxy with a one-time stderr note.
- `packages/host-claude-code/src/event-map.ts` — extend `extractPayload` to pull skill-invocation + token-count signals from raw payloads when present.
- `packages/core/tests/hooks/handlers.test.ts` — extend.
- DESIGN.md note: telemetry signals now load-bearing.

**ACs.** (1) `state.skillAudit.invoked` grows with each tool invocation that matches a skill name. (2) `state.skillAudit.required[]` semantics defined (a config-set list of skills the user expects to invoke at least once per session — if missing at SessionStop, emit a `skill-audit-miss` anomaly). Actually, defer the `required` part to a follow-up phase; 23.4 just wires `invoked`. (3) `tokenUtilization` reads real token counts when the host provides them; documents the fallback path. (4) `cadence status --json` exposes the populated `skillAudit.invoked` array. (5) Backwards compatible with state.json files lacking these fields.

## v0.5.0 — Medium gates

**Theme:** Confirmation gates and the first verifier-agent rollout on a non-AC dimension (code review).

### Phase 24.1 — Manual approve gate (interactive Y/N)

**Objective.** DESIGN.md §4.1 lists `approve` under medium-cost gates. Today `cadence draft approve` is non-interactive (just transitions state). Wire an interactive Y/N prompt when `'approve' ∈ gateSet.gates` (all strict cells + `standard × standard`+). Reuse the Phase 16 prompter abstraction.

**Files.**
- `packages/core/src/cli/commands/draft.ts` — approve action gains a prompter call when gated. Reuses `StdinPrompter` / `ScriptedPrompter` (Phase 16).
- New: `tests/cli/draft-approve-gate.test.ts` using `CADENCE_PROMPTER_SCRIPT` env-var seam.
- DESIGN.md §4.1 — `approve` shipped Phase 24.1.

**ACs.** (1) `cadence draft approve` prompts `Approve and enter BUILD? [y/n]` when gated. (2) `y` proceeds; `n` exits 1 cleanly with no state change. (3) Optional `--no-approve` bypasses the gate per-invocation. (4) Non-TTY refusal unless `--no-approve` (mirrors Phase 16 walker). (5) Gate-aware: outside the gate set, behavior unchanged.

### Phase 24.2 — Per-task verifier agent

**Objective.** DESIGN.md §4.1 lists `per-task-verify` under medium-cost gates (strict × standard+). Each `cadence build task <id> --status=DONE` outcome runs a per-task verifier on just that task's files. Reuses the `Verifier` interface from Phase 15 with a new `PerTaskVerifier` shape (input = `{task, files, diffSinceLastTask}`; output = `pass | concerns | refuse`). Refuse blocks the DONE recording.

**Files.**
- `packages/core/src/verify/per-task.ts` (new) — `PerTaskVerifier` interface + `MockPerTaskVerifier` + `AnthropicPerTaskVerifier`.
- `packages/types/src/config.ts` — `config.perTaskVerifier.provider: 'mock' | 'anthropic'`.
- `packages/core/src/cli/commands/build.ts` — gate-check before `recordTaskOutcome`.
- New: `tests/verify/per-task.test.ts`.
- DESIGN.md §4.1 — `per-task-verify` shipped Phase 24.2.

**ACs.** (1) `Verifier`-style interface for per-task. (2) `Mock` passes iff `files` non-empty and `diff` non-empty (deterministic). (3) `Anthropic` LLM call with prompt-cached system prompt. (4) Gate-aware. (5) `--allow-per-task-failure` bypass. (6) Failures recorded into PROGRESS.json + emit `per-task-fail` anomaly (new event type — `AnomalyTypeZ` schema bump; document in CHANGELOG).

### Phase 24.3 — code-review verifier agent

**Objective.** DESIGN.md §4.1 lists `code-review` under medium-cost. Strict-profile cells reference it. Runs on settle (or maybe at task close — pick one). Same shape as `--deep` verifier from Phase 15. Output: per-file findings (HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW severity). HIGH findings emit a `code-review-high` anomaly (new `AnomalyTypeZ` member — schema bump; shipped 17.1 schema has six types only). HIGH refuses settle unless `--allow-code-review-failure`.

**Files.**
- `packages/core/src/verify/code-review.ts` (new).
- `packages/core/src/cli/commands/settle.ts` — wire gate.
- `packages/types/src/config.ts` — `config.codeReview.provider`.
- `packages/types/src/summary.ts` — `Summary.codeReview?: Record<file, Finding[]>`.
- New: `tests/verify/code-review.test.ts`.
- DESIGN.md §4.1 — `code-review` shipped Phase 24.3.

**ACs.** (1) `CodeReviewVerifier` interface with mock + anthropic. (2) Mock: passes empty diff; flags any `console.log` left in source (deterministic heuristic). (3) Anthropic: per-file review with Zod-typed findings. (4) HIGH findings emit `code-review-high` anomaly via existing event type. (5) HIGH refuses settle unless `--force` or `--allow-code-review-failure`. (6) Summary records findings.

---

## v0.6.0 — Expensive gates

**Theme:** The strict-profile-only gates that round out the matrix.

### Phase 25.1 — plan-review verifier agent

**Objective.** DESIGN.md §4.1 lists `plan-review` as an expensive gate (strict × complex). Runs at DRAFT time — verifies the proposed plan (DRAFT.md content) is coherent, decomposes the right way, and has the right ACs for the goal. Same shape as `--deep` but input is the DRAFT.md text itself, not the diff.

**Files.**
- `packages/core/src/verify/plan-review.ts` (new).
- `packages/core/src/cli/commands/draft.ts` — gate-check at `draft approve` time (before transition to BUILD).
- `packages/types/src/config.ts` — `config.planReview.provider`.
- New: `tests/verify/plan-review.test.ts`.
- DESIGN.md §4.1 — `plan-review` shipped Phase 25.1.

**ACs.** (1) `PlanReviewVerifier` interface, mock + anthropic. (2) Mock: passes iff `acceptanceCriteria.length >= 1` and every AC has non-empty `given/when/then` (deterministic). (3) Anthropic: holistic review with structured output (severity + findings + suggested-edits). (4) Gate-aware. (5) Refuses approve on `pass=false` unless `--allow-plan-review-failure`.

### Phase 25.2 — security-audit verifier agent

**Objective.** Strict × complex only. Final gate before settle. LLM-driven security pass on the diff. Heavy and expensive — only fires on complex+strict, which is the rarest cell.

**Files.**
- `packages/core/src/verify/security-audit.ts` (new).
- `packages/core/src/cli/commands/settle.ts` — wire gate (after code-review, before SUMMARY write).
- `packages/types/src/config.ts` — `config.securityAudit.provider`.
- `packages/types/src/summary.ts` — `Summary.securityAudit?: Finding[]`.
- New: `tests/verify/security-audit.test.ts`.
- DESIGN.md §4.1 — `security-audit` shipped Phase 25.2.

**ACs.** (1) `SecurityAuditVerifier` interface, mock + anthropic. (2) Mock: scans for hardcoded `Authorization:` headers and JWT-shaped strings; deterministic. (3) Anthropic: full prompt with OWASP awareness. (4) CRITICAL severity refuses settle unless `--allow-security-audit-failure`. (5) Findings recorded into SUMMARY.

---

## v0.7.0 — Operator ergonomics

**Theme:** Friction reduction for new + existing users. No new gates.

### Phase 26.1 — `cadence init` UX polish

**Objective.** Today's `cadence init` writes `.cadence/config.json` + skeleton files. Polish: prompt for project name interactively (if no `--name`), suggest a profile based on git history (lots of commits → standard; bare repo → auto), show a one-screen summary of what was scaffolded, link to README.

**Files.**
- `packages/core/src/cli/commands/init.ts`.
- Refresh `tests/cli/init.test.ts`.
- README — update the "Try it" block to match new flow.

**ACs.** (1) Interactive name prompt when `--name` absent. (2) Profile suggestion heuristic + override. (3) Post-init summary on stdout. (4) Non-TTY skips prompts, defaults applied. (5) Existing tests pass + new TTY-mode test.

### Phase 26.2 — `CLAUDE.md` scaffold

**Objective.** Cadence users running through Claude Code get a `CLAUDE.md` written by `cadence init` (or a separate `cadence init --claude-md` flag) that primes Claude on the project's loop, profile, and where state lives. Reduces orientation-tax per session.

**Files.**
- `packages/core/src/cli/commands/init.ts` — add `--claude-md` flag (or always-write).
- `packages/core/src/init/claude-md-template.ts` (new) — template generator.
- New: `tests/cli/init-claude-md.test.ts`.
- README — note the new file.

**ACs.** (1) `cadence init` (or `--claude-md`) writes a `CLAUDE.md` at repo root. (2) Template names the active profile, points at DESIGN.md, lists key commands. (3) Idempotent: re-init preserves user edits if file has no managed marker. (4) Honored by Claude Code on next session start. (5) Documented in README.

### Phase 26.3 — `status anomalies` polish: `--tail` follow mode

**Objective.** `cadence status anomalies` currently does one-shot read. Add `--tail [--follow]` for live-tailing the NDJSON log as new events arrive. Useful when running `cadence settle` in a background terminal and watching events stream into another.

**Files.**
- `packages/core/src/cli/commands/status.ts` — extend the `anomalies` subcommand.
- New: `tests/cli/status-anomalies-tail.test.ts`.
- README — extend the reader section.

**ACs.** (1) `--tail` prints the last N (default 20). (2) `--follow` keeps the file open and streams new events. (3) Ctrl-C exits cleanly. (4) Combines with `--type` filter. (5) Non-TTY falls back to non-follow mode.

---

## v0.8.0 — CI

### Phase 27.1 — GitHub Actions tests-on-PR

**Objective.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `pnpm install && pnpm turbo run lint typecheck test build` on every PR + push to main. Matrix: Node 20 + Node 22. No publish automation.

**Files.**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (new).
- Possibly `.github/dependabot.yml` for dep hygiene.
- README — add a CI badge.

**ACs.** (1) CI runs on PR + push to main. (2) Matrix Node 20 + 22. (3) Tests + lint + typecheck + build all green. (4) Failed CI blocks merge (branch protection — manual GitHub setup, documented). (5) README badge.

---

## v1.0.0 — Release ceremony

### Phase 28.1 — Cut v1.0.0

**Objective.** Final release. All §4.1 gates ship. CHANGELOG updated with the v0.4–v0.8 spread. README v1.0 banner. Tag created locally, push gated on user.

**Files.**
- `packages/{core,types,testkit,host-claude-code}/package.json` — `0.8.0` → `1.0.0`.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — `[1.0.0] - YYYY-MM-DD` entry.
- README — banner refresh.
- DESIGN.md §10 — tick `Phase 28.1 — v1.0.0 release`.

**ACs.** (1) All four packages at `1.0.0`. (2) CHANGELOG fully populated. (3) Annotated tag `v1.0.0` created locally. (4) Push gated on user approval. (5) Full suite green.

---

## Open questions (resolve when each phase starts)

- **23.1** — Should `draftReadAt` also be bumped by `cadence draft check`? (Probably not — check is read-only.)
- **23.4** — ✓ **RESOLVED (Phase 34.1):** `required[]` = DRAFT frontmatter `requiredSkills` ∪ `config.skillAudit.required`, enforced at `settle run` (declaration = opt-in; unconditional `skill-audit-miss` anomaly; `--allow-skill-audit-miss` bypass). 23.4's AC-2 SessionStop-anomaly idea superseded by the settle-time check.
- **24.2** — Should `per-task-verify` fire at `--status=DONE` only, or also at `BLOCKED` / `NEEDS_CONTEXT`? (Probably DONE only — others are explicit human escalations.)
- **24.3** — Code review runs at settle or per-task close? (Plan says settle; revisit if per-task gives better feedback loop.)
- **25.1** — `plan-review` at `draft new` (before approve) or at `draft approve` (gates BUILD entry)? (Plan says approve-time; consider draft-new for stricter profiles.)
- **25.2** — Security-audit triggers on every settle, or only on strict×complex per matrix? (Per matrix — keep it expensive-by-default.)
- **26.2** — CLAUDE.md content: should it embed `cadence status` output as a section the agent re-reads each session? Or just a static project blurb? (Brainstorm at phase start.)
- **29.1** — Foreign project: **RESOLVED — `~/Documents/Projects/continuity-runtime`** (temporarily abandoned, usable as a test target). Real 75-commit history not shaped for cadence; **npm single-package** (`package-lock.json`, `src/`+`tests/`, no `packages/`) so the default `testGlobs=packages/**/*.test.ts(x)` *should* miss its tests — the highest-value pre-publish finding. biome (≠ cadence eslint), vitest, TypeScript; clean tree, no `.cadence/`. **Two caveats to carry into 29.1-DRAFT:** (a) pre-existing `.claude/` + `.planning/` — `.planning/` is harmless GSD residue, but `.claude/` means host-install must *merge into* a non-empty `.claude/settings.json` (in-scope whether wanted or not — and a realistic user condition). (b) Same TS+vitest family → stresses layout/tooling foreignness, **not** language foreignness; "are gates JS-tuned" stays an explicit out-of-scope boundary (documented, or a later phase).
- **29.2** — `anthropic` providers cost real API spend per run. Cap to one strict×complex phase, or sweep every anthropic gate at least once? (Plan: one representative phase that trips all five gates; widen only if findings warrant.)
- **30.1** — changesets vs hand-rolled release workflow; public npm vs private registry; npm provenance on/off. (Brainstorm at 30.1-DRAFT — this is the irreversible-once-published decision.)

---

## Process decision — stay on the CADENCE loop, do not migrate to GSD (2026-05-15)

**Decided:** development process stays on the dogfooded CADENCE `DRAFT → BUILD → SETTLE` loop with `.cadence/` as the single system of record. We will **not** move the meta-process onto GSD (`.planning/`, `gsd-*` skills). Settled — do not re-litigate without a material change in the reasons below.

**Why:**
1. **Dogfooding is the validation strategy, not a habit.** v1.1's entire thesis is that CADENCE needs more real-loop miles. Running phases through GSD instead would zero out the very coverage this milestone exists to add — self-undermining.
2. **Two planning systems = split brain.** ROADMAP/state live in `.cadence/`; GSD wants its own `.planning/` roadmap + state machine. No clean "GSD owns process, CADENCE owns code" seam — both *are* the process. Dual systems mean drift + import/conflict tax.
3. **Process maturity already present.** Two-commit-per-phase, annotated milestone tags, conventions doc, handoffs, green dogfood loop. GSD's heavy machinery (research / plan-check / verify subagents, parallel waves, convergence) solves problems a solo, well-scoped, full-context project does not have.

**Escape hatch (the only sanctioned GSD/superpowers use):** borrow individual skills as point tools at irreversible / high-ambiguity junctures only — system of record stays `.cadence/`. Pre-approved:
- `brainstorming` / `grill-me` before **Phase 30.1** (publish is irreversible — Open question 30.1 already flags it).
- `grill-with-docs` to pressure-test the **Phase 29.1** foreign-project pick.

Revisit only if: a second host returns (multi-host coordination), the team grows past solo, or a phase genuinely needs parallel-wave execution the CADENCE loop can't express.

## v1.1.0 — Battle-test shakedown + publish pipeline

**Status:** v0.4 → v1.0 fully shipped (Phases 13–28.1), tagged through `v1.0.0`, pushed. Loop IDLE. v1.1 thesis: **CADENCE has only ever run its own happy path (`auto × standard`, `mock` providers, one host, one OS, one project — itself). Self-dogfood validated the spine; it cannot validate "works because the project IS cadence."** Phases 29.x close the validation gap; 30.1 ships publish — and is **gated on 29.4** so we never publish an untested loop. Server-side CI enforcement, the backlog parking lot, and the deferred open questions (23.1 / 23.4 / 24.3 / 26.2) move to **v1.2+** to keep this milestone tight. (23.4 resolved — Phase 34.1; see v1.2 feature-expansion.)

### Phase 29.1 — Real-project shakedown (foreign repo)

**Objective.** Run CADENCE end-to-end on a **non-cadence** project. `cadence init` a real codebase (greenfield or small existing project with ≥1 real feature), then drive ≥2 real phases through `DRAFT → BUILD → SETTLE` at the default `auto × standard`. Goal is the blind-spot catch: assumptions that only hold because the dogfood target is cadence itself (path layout, monorepo shape, test-glob defaults, git-history heuristics in `init`).

**Files.**
- `.cadence/shakedown/29-01-FOREIGN.md` (new) — the foreign project chosen, commands run, every friction point / bug / surprising default, verbatim error text.
- No `packages/**` changes in this phase — observation only; fixes land in 29.4.

**ACs.** (1) A non-cadence project initialized via `cadence init` (record the `--gate-profile` suggestion vs. what was correct). (2) ≥2 phases taken full-loop to a written SUMMARY on that project. (3) Friction log captures every deviation from documented behavior with verbatim output. (4) Each finding tagged `bug | docs | ux | works-as-designed`.

---

### Phase 29.2 — Expensive-gate live exercise (strict×complex, `anthropic` providers)

**Objective.** Exercise the matrix surface that has **never run through a real loop** — only unit tests (handoff convention: 25.x gates tested, not dogfooded). Run ≥1 phase at `strict × complex` with `verifier/codeReview/perTaskVerifier/planReview/securityAudit` provider = `anthropic` and a live `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, so plan-review (`draft approve`), per-task-verify, code-review, deep verifier, and security-audit (`settle run`) all fire against real input.

**Files.**
- `.cadence/shakedown/29-02-EXPENSIVE.md` (new) — per-gate: did it fire, real verdict, false-positive/negative assessment, latency, rough token cost.
- Config diffs (provider/profile) recorded in the report; no committed config flip (the dogfood loop must stay `auto × standard` per handoff convention — use a scratch config or env override).

**ACs.** (1) One phase reaches BUILD through a live `anthropic` plan-review at `draft approve`. (2) per-task-verify + code-review + deep verifier produce real (non-mock) verdicts on real diff. (3) security-audit runs on a real `git diff` at settle. (4) Each gate's real-world precision assessed (false positive / false negative / sane) with the model's actual output quoted. (5) `--allow-*-failure` and `--force` bypasses confirmed to behave as documented when a real gate refuses.

---

### Phase 29.3 — Interactive / approve TTY exercise

**Objective.** The manual `approve` prompt and `--interactive` AC walker are only ever driven by `CADENCE_PROMPTER_SCRIPT` in tests — never a real TTY. Exercise both interactively by a human and confirm the non-TTY refusal paths (CI, piped stdin) match the README.

**Files.**
- `.cadence/shakedown/29-03-TTY.md` (new) — transcript notes: prompt clarity, retry behavior, the `n`/empty/3-retry refusal, `--no-approve`/`--no-interactive` bypass, non-TTY stderr message wording.

**ACs.** (1) `draft approve` y/n prompt driven on a real TTY incl. the refuse-and-leave-state-untouched path. (2) `settle run --interactive` walked per-AC on a real TTY with pass/fail/skip + note. (3) Non-TTY refusal verified for both gates (clear stderr, exit 1). (4) Any wording/UX friction logged for 29.4.

---

### Phase 29.4 — Shakedown remediation

**Objective.** Fold every `bug`/`docs`/`ux` finding from 29.1–29.3 into real fixes. This is the gate before publish: if the shakedown found nothing, that itself is the (verified) result. `works-as-designed` items are closed with a one-line rationale, not changed.

**Files.**
- `packages/**` — fixes per finding (scoped by the reports).
- `README.md` / `DESIGN.md` — doc corrections for any behavior the shakedown proved misdocumented.
- `.cadence/shakedown/29-04-REMEDIATION.md` (new) — finding → disposition (fixed-commit / doc-fixed / wontfix-rationale) table.

**Depends on.** 29.1, 29.2, 29.3.

**ACs.** (1) Every `bug` finding either fixed (with test) or explicitly deferred to v1.2 with rationale. (2) Every `docs` finding corrected in README/DESIGN. (3) Remediation table maps each finding to disposition. (4) Full suite green after fixes. (5) No open `bug`-tagged finding remains undispositioned.

---

## v1.1.0 — Publish pipeline

### Phase 30.1 — Publish pipeline

**Status: ✓ Delivered v1.1 via the reversible proof path** (dogfood phase `33-publish-pipeline`/`33-01`). Metadata hardened on the 3 publishable packages (`@cadence/testkit` → `private`, dev-only); `scripts/publish-proof.mjs` proves real `pnpm publish` → clean-install → no `workspace:` leak → both bins run against an ephemeral local verdaccio with Windows-safe teardown; public `pnpm publish --dry-run` + `npm pack` confirm the public shape (tarballs = dist/bin/package.json/LICENSE/README only). ACs 1–6 met **by the reversible variant** (AC-6's "scoped-test publish … private registry" path). The irreversible remainder — real public publish, provenance, `release.yml`, changesets — is the **v1.2 "Public release"** milestone below. Spec/plan: `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-05-16-publish-pipeline*`.

**Objective.** Real release automation — the deliberate Phase 28.1 boundary. changesets (or hand-rolled), a release workflow, npm provenance, public-npm vs private-registry decision. **Must include a dry-run publish** of all four packages and verify the published tarball contents (no source leak, correct `files`/`exports`, `bin` resolves).

**Files.**
- `.changeset/` + `.github/workflows/release.yml` (new), or equivalent hand-rolled release script.
- `packages/{core,types,testkit,host-claude-code}/package.json` — `files`, `exports`, `bin`, `publishConfig`, `repository`, `provenance` as needed.
- README — install line switches from local-dogfood to published `npx @cadence/core`.
- `DESIGN.md` — publish-pipeline section.

**Depends on.** 29.4 (do not publish an unvalidated loop).

**ACs.** (1) `pnpm -r publish --dry-run` (or changesets equivalent) succeeds for all four packages. (2) Tarball inspected: no stray source/test/`.cadence` files, `bin` resolves from a clean install. (3) Release workflow gated on green CI (`needs: ci-success`). (4) Registry target (public npm vs private) decided and documented. (5) Provenance decision documented. (6) A real or scoped-test publish proves the path (revocable: `npm unpublish`/dist-tag, or a private registry).

## Deferred to v1.2+ (not in v1.1 scope)

- **Server-side CI enforcement.** The repo is now **public** and a server-side `ci-success` required check is active (a push to `main` reported it as *expected*, though still admin-bypassable). Remaining: fully require it (no bypass) and retire the client-side `.githooks/pre-push` hook — or keep the hook as belt-and-suspenders. (History: while private on GitHub Free, only the client-side hook gated `main`.)
- **Backlog parking lot.** No `.cadence/` backlog file exists; stand one up (`gsd-add-backlog`-style) so ideas have a home.
- **Deferred open questions.** 23.1, 24.3, 26.2 — real product decisions, a phase each when picked up. (24.2 may be folded in if 29.2/29.3 surface it.) (23.4 resolved — Phase 34.1.)
- **Test infra.** ✓ **Pulled forward into v1.1 — delivered as Phase 32.1** (shared `vitest.shared.ts` base: `testTimeout`/`hookTimeout`/`maxForks`; `tempRepo` rmdir retry; 29.5/30.2 per-test band-aids reverted). The deferral boundary was deliberately broken: the flake was costing a blocking pre-push failure + a remediation phase roughly every push (3rd recurrence at Phase 31.1).
- **Intelligence module internal seams** (architecture review 2026-05-25 candidate #6 — *speculative, monitor*). Today: 16+ files, 2,971 LoC under `packages/core/src/intelligence/`, no internal seams. Future seams (when pain arrives): `ledger` (read/write/id-gen/supersede) · `render` (markdown spine + per-kind shapes) · `scan/recommend` (read-only views) · `cli surface` — three internal modules, one external interface. **Trigger condition (do NOT refactor speculatively):** the first time a markdown-render change requires editing ≥4 files in `intelligence/`. Until then, leave alone.

## v1.4.0 — Public release (DELIVERED 2026-06-02)

**Status:** **closed 2026-06-02** via phase `45-public-release` (DRAFT 45-01). The first publish happened out of band on 2026-05-30 (repo public + npm `1.1.1`); the version-hygiene remainder is now done. **Renumbered from v1.2.0 on 2026-05-25** to sit *after* the architecture-deepening milestone (v1.3.0). See MILESTONES.md for the full delivered checklist.

**Delivered.**
- ✓ **Public-npm publish** of `@manehorizons/cadence-{core,types,host-claude-code}@1.4.0` (2026-06-02, via `release.yml` CI). testkit stays private.
- ✓ **Version hygiene** — `1.1.1 → 1.4.0` (first published version matching `main`); annotated git tag `v1.4.0` at the published commit (`fbbcf91`). Earlier `1.1.1` left as-is (fix-forward).
- ✓ **npm provenance** — `--provenance` via OIDC in `release.yml`; `slsa.dev/provenance/v1` attestation confirmed on npm.
- ✓ **changesets** adopted (`@changesets/cli` + `.changeset/config.json`, access public, testkit ignored) for future releases.
- ✓ **`@manehorizons/cadence-testkit`** re-decided: stays `private`.
- Note: zod `^3 → ^4` shipped as a public-API-affecting dep change, documented in CHANGELOG `[1.4.0]`.

**Depended on.** Phase 30.1 (reversible proof) + the repo-visibility decision (resolved — repo public).

---

## v1.5.0 — Multi-host (deferred, named)

**Status:** named & scoped, NOT started. Added 2026-05-30. Sequenced **after** v1.4 Public release — going public is what surfaces real demand for a second host (which tool, from actual users), and a published host-agnostic CLI + a documented adapter contract is the thing third parties build against. Additive (engine unchanged) → minor bump, consistent with DESIGN's "multi-host is a v1.x/v2 concern."

**Reverses, deliberately, the Phase 11 archive (D5 / D9 / F3).** v1 collapsed dual-host as premature (YAGNI) — `packages/host-codex/` removed from main, the `HostCapabilities` abstraction folded back into Claude-Code-specific code, prior state preserved at the `keel-codex-archive` tag. This milestone is the "re-add later as a fresh phase if needed" escape hatch that decision left open, opened **only now that the single-host loop is solid and the engine is proven in public use**. The host-agnostic-engine anchor is **not** inverted: adapters keep translating a host's lifecycle into the abstract events the core dispatcher already speaks (`packages/host-claude-code/src/event-map.ts` — `SessionStart→session-start`, `PreToolUse→pre-tool-edit`, …); the engine stays host-unaware.

**Scope.**
- **Re-introduce a host-adapter contract** — the leaner successor to the collapsed `HostCapabilities`, derived from what `host-claude-code` *actually* needs (event map + payload extraction + install/shim/locate-self), not speculative capability flags. Prior art lives at the `keel-codex-archive` tag.
- **First second adapter** — a new `@cadence/host-<tool>` package mirroring `host-claude-code` (lifecycle → abstract events + an installer). **Target chosen by post-public user pull** (Codex / Gemini / Aider / OpenCode — do not pick speculatively).
- **Generalize the testkit mock host** so adapter tests don't hard-code Claude Code semantics.
- **"Write your own adapter" doc** — publish the abstract-event contract + a worked example so third parties can add hosts without core changes.

**Depends on.** v1.4 (public release) + a concrete second-host demand signal. **Activation gate:** do NOT start speculatively. The original anti-goal ("no multi-host complexity before single-host is solid") is now satisfied; the remaining guard is "no second adapter without a real user for it." Pick the first target tool from actual post-publish demand, then scope it into phases.

## v1.2.0 — Feature expansion (superpowers-inspired)

Source: `docs/superpowers/2026-05-16-cadence-expansion-survey.md` (full weighing of 6 candidates). CADENCE ships DRAFT→BUILD→SETTLE; this milestone closes the gap toward the full idea→shipped arc that superpowers covers manually today.

- **#6 Required-skill enforcement** — ✓ **delivered Phase 34.1** (closes open-question 23.4).
- **#2 Review-convergence loop primitive** — ✓ **delivered Phase 35.1** (pure `nextConvergence`; `plan-review`@approve bounded with sidecar attempts + escalation; reused by #4).
- **#1 brainstorm→spec stage** — ✓ **delivered Phase 36.1** (SPEC loop position + `cadence spec new/check/approve`; convergent spec-review reuses #2's `nextConvergence`; host-agnostic scaffold+validate). **SPEC→DRAFT content auto-seed delivered as #1b (Phase 38.1).**
- **#4 Code-review convergence at settle** — ✓ **delivered Phase 37.1** (Phase 24.3 code-review@settle wrapped in the Phase 35.1 `nextConvergence`; `<id>-CODE-REVIEW.json` attempts + escalation; `--force`/`--allow-code-review-failure` contract preserved; the third `nextConvergence` attach-point).
- **#1b SPEC→DRAFT auto-seed** — ✓ **delivered Phase 38.1** (`draft new` reads the sibling same-id `APPROVED` SPEC → pre-fills DRAFT Objective + ACs via pure `renderDraftBody`; additive `AcceptanceCriterionZ.name`; byte-identical legacy fallback). Closes #1 fully.
- **#3 `cadence build --subagent` / #5 `cadence research` stage — PARKED.** Both invert the host-agnostic-engine anchor (cadence is driven *by* an agent; it is not an agent/research orchestrator). Revisit ONLY if that anchor is reconsidered.

Sequence: #6 ✓ → #2 ✓ → #1 ✓ → #4 ✓ → #1b ✓ ; #3/#5 parked (host-agnostic-anchor conflict). v1.2 feature-expansion COMPLETE — no non-parked work remains.

---

## v1.3.0 — Architecture deepening

**Theme:** Interface tightening. Pull policy out of CLI commands into reusable deep modules; collapse adapter farms into one generic factory; close half-leaking seams. No new user-facing features.

**Source.** `/tmp/architecture-review-20260525-103233.html` — 6-candidate review run against the `praxis-intelligence-ledger` branch on 2026-05-25 using the `improve-codebase-architecture` skill. Top recommendation: candidate #2 (lift the gate engine out of CLI commands) — it unlocks #3 and #5 "almost for free." Candidate #6 (intelligence/ internal seams) is **parked** in the Deferred section above with an explicit trigger condition.

**Anchor decisions** (set 2026-05-25):
- v1.3 sits **before** v1.4 Public release — tighten interfaces before they harden in the public API surface.
- **Sequencing:** Phase 39.x (gate extraction) first; 40.1 / 41.1 / 42.1 independent; 43.1 last (depends on the gate-module pattern from 39.x).
- **Deletion-test discipline.** Every phase passes: delete the command/handler that triggered the gate, and the gate logic is still discoverable + reusable from the new module.
- **Bit-identical contract.** No phase changes user-visible behavior. Golden transcripts / snapshot tests anchor each extraction.

**Pressure-test revisions** (set 2026-05-29 — code-grounded review of the roadmap against `gates/engine.ts`, `settle.ts`, the `Gate` enum in `packages/types/src/profile.ts`, and the verify/notify dirs):
- **Registry endgame, hybrid-sequenced.** `gates/engine.ts` already computes the ordered `effectiveGateSet().gates: Gate[]`, and `settle.ts` already guards each inline block with `gateSet.gates.includes(<gate>)` — the engine's gate set is *already partially load-bearing*. 39.x extracts gates as hand-wired `runXGate(ctx)` calls (low blast radius), but **39.1 designs a registry-ready, uniform `GateImpl(ctx) => Promise<GateResult>` shape**. A new **Phase 44.1** then converts the hand-wired calls into an engine-driven `Record<Gate, GateImpl>` registry that `settle` drives by iterating `effectiveGateSet().gates`. This makes `gatesFor` load-bearing (one source of truth for which gates fire *and* in what order) instead of advisory. Consistent with 40.1/42.1's consolidate-the-duplication philosophy, deferred so the per-phase extractions stay mechanical.
- **Total registry over the `Gate` enum.** The enum has 13 members; the original roadmap extracted only 9 and left `structural-verifier`, `build-test-must-pass`, `draft-read`, `anomaly-notify` inline. **Phase 39.2** (freed up — deep-verify moved into 39.1) extracts the first three as discrete gate impls so the registry is *total*. **`anomaly-notify` is the deliberate exception** — it is not a discrete gate but a cross-cutting emission toggle threaded through other gates' blocks (`settle.ts:517,541,734`, plus `build.ts`, `hooks/handlers.ts`); it stays a `ctx.shouldNotify` flag the other impls consult, **not** a registry entry. Net registry = 12 discrete impls + 1 modifier flag.
- **Non-gates move out of `gates/`.** `skill-audit` (39.6) and `boundary` (43.1) are **not** in the `Gate` enum — they are anomaly checks, not profile×tier gates. They relocate to a new **`packages/core/src/checks/`** namespace and stay *outside* the registry. Keeps `gates/` coherent: one decision engine + 12 enum-gate impls.
- **Ports decouple the consolidations.** Gates depend on injected collaborators carried by `SettleContext` — a **verifier port** (already implied by 39.2) and an **emit port** (`ctx.emitUnconverged`). 39.4/39.7 wire to the emit *port*, so 40.1 (verifier factory) and 42.1 (emit spine) consolidate *behind* the ports — invisible to the gates. This makes "40.1/41.1/42.1 independent" actually true and removes the 42.1-vs-39.4/39.7 double-touch churn.
- **De-risk 39.1.** 39.1 extracts **two** gates (coverage **and** deep-verify) to validate the `SettleContext`/`GateResult`/`GateImpl` shape against real variety before six more phases commit to it.
- **Estimate corrections.** `draft.ts` is **506 LoC** (roadmap said 456). 41.1's "~23 call sites" is closer to **~13 `renderStateMd` references across ~7 files**, and the interface is named **`StateBackend`** (not `Backend`). ACs updated to real numbers below.

### Phase 39.1 — Lift the coverage + deep-verify gates out of settle.ts (shape-defining phase)

**Objective.** Pull **two** inline gates from `cli/commands/settle.ts` (currently 900 LoC, gates inlined in one ~800-line command action) into `core/src/gates/` — the test-coverage gate and the `--deep` verifier gate — and in doing so **define the shared `SettleContext` / `GateResult` / `GateImpl` contract** the rest of v1.3 consumes. Two gates (not one) so the shape is validated against real variety — a pure-policy gate (coverage) and a port-consuming gate (deep-verify needs an injected verifier) — before six more phases commit to it. Settle builds context and routes; no policy stays inline.

**Registry-ready shape (load-bearing for Phase 44.1).** `GateImpl` is `(ctx: SettleContext) => Promise<GateResult>` — uniform across every gate, so 44.1 can drop the modules into a `Record<Gate, GateImpl>` registry with no re-extraction. `SettleContext` carries **injected collaborator ports**: a `verifier` port and an `emitUnconverged` port (so 40.1/42.1 consolidate behind them), plus `shouldNotify` (the `anomaly-notify` toggle — see Pressure-test revisions). `GateResult` is a uniform `{ outcome, anomalies?, summaryPatch? }` shape, not gate-specific returns.

**Files.**
- `packages/core/src/gates/coverage.ts` (new).
- `packages/core/src/gates/deep-verify.ts` (new — moved up from old 39.2).
- `packages/core/src/gates/types.ts` (new) — `SettleContext`, `GateResult`, `GateImpl`, and the port interfaces (`VerifierPort`, `EmitPort`), shared with all subsequent 39.x phases.
- `packages/core/src/cli/commands/settle.ts` — replace both inline blocks with `runCoverageGate(ctx)` / `runDeepVerifyGate(ctx)`.
- `packages/core/tests/gates/{coverage,deep-verify}.test.ts` (new) — tests target the gates directly, not the CLI surface.

**ACs.** (1) `runCoverageGate(ctx)` and `runDeepVerifyGate(ctx)` are the single homes for their gate logic. (2) `GateImpl` shape is uniform across both and registry-ready (validated by both gates conforming without per-gate casts). (3) `settle.ts` no longer references `verification.testGlobs` or coverage/deep-verify parsing directly. (4) Gate tests reach every branch without standing up the CLI stack. (5) Verifier reaches deep-verify via the `ctx.verifier` port, not a direct factory import. (6) Settle-time behavior bit-identical to pre-extraction (transcript-snapshot test). (7) `settle.ts` net LoC drops by both inline blocks' size + framing.

### Phase 39.2 — Lift the remaining always-fire / cheap enum gates (registry completion)

**Objective.** (Pressure-test addition — *total registry over the enum*.) The original roadmap left four `Gate`-enum members inline. This phase extracts the three that are discrete checks — `structural-verifier`, `build-test-must-pass`, `draft-read` (the Phase 23.1 DRAFT-read mtime gate at `settle.ts:171`) — into `gates/{structural-verifier,build-test,draft-read}.ts`, conforming to the `GateImpl` shape from 39.1. After this, every enum gate except `anomaly-notify` has a discrete module, so Phase 44.1's registry can be *total*. `anomaly-notify` is intentionally NOT extracted — it is a cross-cutting `ctx.shouldNotify` emission toggle, not a discrete gate.

**Files.**
- `packages/core/src/gates/{structural-verifier,build-test,draft-read}.ts` (new).
- `packages/core/src/cli/commands/settle.ts` — replace the three inline blocks with gate calls.
- `packages/core/src/cli/commands/draft.ts` — these three also appear in draft's path; route there too.
- `packages/core/tests/gates/{structural-verifier,build-test,draft-read}.test.ts` (new).

**ACs.** (1) Three new gate modules conform to the 39.1 `GateImpl` shape. (2) `settle.ts` and `draft.ts` route only for these gates — no inline policy. (3) The `gateSet.gates.includes('draft-read')` guard semantics (mtime baseline + `--allow-stale-draft`) preserved. (4) Tests target gates, not the CLI. (5) Behavior bit-identical. (6) Every `Gate` enum member except `anomaly-notify` now has a discrete `gates/*.ts` module.

**As built (2026-05-29) — bit-identical anchor amended (operator decision).** AC #5 was found false at plan time: only `draft-read` had inline enforcement; `structural-verifier` and `build-test-must-pass` were `ALWAYS_FIRE` enum members with **zero in-engine enforcement** (decorative — see the v0.6-era "matrix no longer decorative" v1.0 anchor that was never actually satisfied for these two). Rather than document them as external exceptions, the operator chose to **wire them for real**, consciously trading this phase's bit-identical guarantee to make the matrix load-bearing:
- `draft-read` → `gates/draft-read.ts`: verbatim extraction, **bit-identical** (transcript-anchored). AC #3/#5 hold for it.
- `structural-verifier` → `gates/structural-verifier.ts`: **new refusal** on `PENDING`/`IN_PROGRESS` tasks (terminal = DONE / DONE_WITH_CONCERNS / NEEDS_CONTEXT / BLOCKED). Bypass `--allow-open-tasks` / `--force`.
- `build-test-must-pass` → `gates/build-test-must-pass.ts`: **new refusal** on a non-zero `verification.testCommand` exit, via an injected `RunnerPort`. Config-gated — unset `testCommand` ⇒ passes silently (preserves bit-identical for existing green settles, AC-7). Bypass `--allow-failing-build` / `--force`.

AC #2 deviation: `draft.ts` was **not** touched — these gates have no `draft.ts` enforcement site (they fire at settle). Net result still satisfies AC #6: 5 enum gates now have `gates/*.ts` modules (coverage, deep-verify, draft-read, structural-verifier, build-test-must-pass); `anomaly-notify` is the exception; the remaining 7 await 39.3–39.7. Design + plan: `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-05-29-*39.2*`.

### Phase 39.3 — Lift the interactive AC-walker out of settle.ts

**Objective.** Pull the Phase 16 `--interactive` per-AC walker (StdinPrompter / ScriptedPrompter / non-TTY refusal) into `gates/interactive.ts` exposing `runInteractiveGate(ctx)`.

**Files.**
- `packages/core/src/gates/interactive.ts` (new).
- `packages/core/src/cli/commands/settle.ts`.
- `packages/core/tests/gates/interactive.test.ts` (new) — drives via `CADENCE_PROMPTER_SCRIPT` seam.

**ACs.** (1) Walker is one module; prompter still injectable. (2) Settle routes only. (3) Non-TTY refusal preserved. (4) Per-AC `pass/fail/skip + note` semantics preserved. (5) Behavior bit-identical.

### Phase 39.4 — Lift the code-review gate (+ convergence sidecar) out of settle.ts

**Objective.** Pull the Phase 24.3 code-review verifier gate **and** its Phase 37.1 convergence sidecar into one module: `gates/code-review.ts`. The convergence-sidecar centralization is the bonus win the architecture review called out for this phase.

**Files.**
- `packages/core/src/gates/code-review.ts` (new) — `runCodeReviewGate(ctx)` calls the verifier **via `ctx.verifier`**, drives the `nextConvergence` loop, writes the `<id>-CODE-REVIEW.json` sidecar, emits convergence anomalies **via `ctx.emitUnconverged`** (the port — not a direct `notify/code-review.ts` import).
- `packages/core/src/cli/commands/settle.ts`.
- `packages/core/tests/gates/code-review.test.ts` (new).

**ACs.** (1) Gate + sidecar live in one module. (2) Phase 35.1 `nextConvergence` primitive consumed without modification. (3) `--allow-code-review-failure` and `--force` contracts preserved. (4) Settle.ts routes only. (5) Sidecar attempts + escalation behavior bit-identical to Phase 37.1 baseline (snapshot-tested). (6) Convergence anomalies emitted through `ctx.emitUnconverged`, so 42.1's spine swap is invisible here (no re-touch).

### Phase 39.5 — Lift the security-audit gate out of settle.ts

**Objective.** Pull the Phase 25.2 security-audit verifier gate into `gates/security-audit.ts`.

**Files.**
- `packages/core/src/gates/security-audit.ts` (new).
- `packages/core/src/cli/commands/settle.ts`.
- `packages/core/tests/gates/security-audit.test.ts` (new).

**ACs.** (1) Gate is one module. (2) `--allow-security-audit-failure` / `--force` preserved. (3) `Summary.securityAudit` recording stays. (4) CRITICAL refusal preserved. (5) Behavior bit-identical.

### Phase 39.6 — Lift the skill-audit check out of settle.ts (into `checks/`, not `gates/`)

**Objective.** Pull the Phase 34.1 required-skill enforcement (skill-audit-miss anomaly + `--allow-skill-audit-miss` bypass) into `checks/skill-audit.ts`. **Note (pressure-test):** `skill-audit` is **not** a member of the `Gate` enum — it's an anomaly check, not a profile×tier gate — so it lives in the new `packages/core/src/checks/` namespace and stays *outside* the Phase 44.1 registry. It may still reuse the `GateResult` shape for a uniform return, but it is dispatched explicitly, not via the gate set.

**Files.**
- `packages/core/src/checks/skill-audit.ts` (new).
- `packages/core/src/cli/commands/settle.ts`.
- `packages/core/tests/checks/skill-audit.test.ts` (new).

**ACs.** (1) Check is one module under `checks/`. (2) DRAFT frontmatter `requiredSkills` ∪ `config.skillAudit.required` union semantics preserved. (3) `--allow-skill-audit-miss` bypass preserved. (4) `state.skillAudit.invoked[]` source-of-truth unchanged. (5) Behavior bit-identical. (6) `checks/` is not referenced by `gates/engine.ts` or the registry — dispatched explicitly from settle.

### Phase 39.7 — Lift the draft + build command gates

**Objective.** With settle.ts now a router, do the same for `draft.ts` (**506 LoC** as of 2026-05-29) and `build.ts` (274 LoC). Draft holds the approve, plan-review (+ Phase 35.1 convergence sidecar), and coherence gates; build holds per-task-verify (Phase 24.2). One phase covers both because each gate is small in isolation. Plan-review's convergence emission goes through `ctx.emitUnconverged` (the port), same as 39.4.

**Files.**
- `packages/core/src/gates/{approve, plan-review, coherence, per-task-verify}.ts` (new).
- `packages/core/src/cli/commands/{draft, build}.ts` — shrink to routers.
- `packages/core/tests/gates/{approve, plan-review, coherence, per-task-verify}.test.ts` (new per gate).

**ACs.** (1) Four new gate modules exist, conforming to the 39.1 `GateImpl` shape. (2) `draft.ts` drops under 200 LoC (a steeper cut than first scoped — it's 506, not 456). (3) `build.ts` drops under 150 LoC. (4) Plan-review convergence sidecar preserved (`nextConvergence` consumed unchanged), emitted via `ctx.emitUnconverged`. (5) Phase 24.1, 24.2, 25.1 contracts all preserved. (6) Behavior bit-identical at the CLI surface (transcript snapshots).

### Phase 40.1 — Verifier factory consolidation

**Objective.** (Architecture review candidate #1.) Six factory files under `packages/core/src/verify/` (`factory.ts`, `code-review-factory.ts`, `plan-review-factory.ts`, `spec-review-factory.ts`, `per-task-factory.ts`, `security-audit-factory.ts` — ~355 LoC total) repeat one selection algorithm with a `mock | anthropic | local` switch and identical fallback warnings. Collapse into one generic `createVerifierFactory<P, V>(spec)` plus six ~10-line bindings.

**Files.**
- `packages/core/src/verify/factory-generic.ts` (new) — `createVerifierFactory<P, V>(spec)` owns the provider switch, anthropic-key fallback, local-url fallback, and warn injection.
- `packages/core/src/verify/{verifier, code-review, plan-review, spec-review, per-task, security-audit}-factory.ts` — shrink to thin bindings.
- `packages/core/tests/verify/factory-generic.test.ts` (new) — fallback / warn rules tested once.

**ACs.** (1) Generic factory exists; six bindings each ≤ 15 LoC. (2) Fallback-warning rule lives in exactly one place. (3) Adding a seventh verifier type costs ≤ 10 lines + a spec. (4) Behavior bit-identical at every consumer call site. (5) No factory file remains over 20 LoC.

### Phase 41.1 — Backend `commit(state)` seam

**Objective.** (Architecture review candidate #3.) The `StateBackend` interface (`state/backend.ts:3` — note: named `StateBackend`, not `Backend`) is too narrow: **~13 `renderStateMd` references across ~7 files** (`cli/commands/{settle,draft,init,spec}.ts`, `hooks/handlers.ts`, `build/record.ts`) pair `backend.writeState(state)` with a manual `renderStateMd(state)` + `atomicWriteText(STATE.md, …)`. Forgetting the second step = stale `STATE.md`. Add `backend.commit(state)` that writes both artefacts; demote `writeState` to package-internal.

**Files.**
- `packages/core/src/state/backend.ts` — add `commit(state): Promise<void>` to the `StateBackend` interface; implement in `SimpleBackend`.
- `packages/core/src/state/simple.ts`.
- All two-step call sites (~13 across ~7 files) — swap the two-step pattern for `commit(state)`.
- `packages/core/tests/state/commit.test.ts` (new) — both artefacts written atomically.

**ACs.** (1) `backend.commit(state)` writes `state.json` and `STATE.md` together. (2) No caller outside `state/` imports `renderStateMd` directly. (3) `writeState` is no longer in the public `StateBackend` interface (or is clearly marked internal). (4) A new state-derived artefact can be added by changing one method. (5) Whole class of stale-STATE.md bugs gone — no two-step path remains for callers to omit.

### Phase 42.1 — `emitUnconverged` notify spine

**Objective.** (Architecture review candidate #4.) Three convergence emitters under `packages/core/src/notify/` (`plan-review.ts`, `spec-review.ts`, `code-review.ts` — ~48 LoC each) share an identical try / notify / stderr-degrade spine; ~70 % is duplication. Extract `emitUnconverged(notifier, kind, payload)`; the three sites supply only the payload. **Decoupled by design (pressure-test):** 39.4/39.7 already consume convergence emission through the `ctx.emitUnconverged` port, so this phase is a pure internal swap *behind* the port — the extracted gates need no re-touch, and 42.1 is genuinely order-independent w.r.t. 39.x.

**Files.**
- `packages/core/src/notify/emit-unconverged.ts` (new) — the spine: try, notify, degrade-on-throw, ts-stamp.
- `packages/core/src/notify/{plan-review, spec-review, code-review}.ts` — shrink to payload builders.
- `packages/core/tests/notify/emit-unconverged.test.ts` (new) — spine tested once.

**ACs.** (1) `emitUnconverged` is the single home for the transport contract. (2) Each of the three emitters becomes ≤ 8 LoC (payload + call). (3) Stderr-degrade behavior identical across all three kinds (centrally tested). (4) Adding a fourth convergence emitter costs ≤ 4 LoC. (5) Notifier injection seam unchanged.

### Phase 43.1 — Drain boundary-check logic from `handlePreToolEdit` (into `checks/`)

**Objective.** (Architecture review candidate #5.) The `handlePreToolEdit` handler in `hooks/handlers.ts` inlines five layers (parse DRAFT, walk files vs. `task.files`, decide boundary, build `AnomalyEvent`, notify with stderr fallback). Same intent as the settle-time boundary detection in `collectAnomalies`, but distinct code. Extract `checks/boundary.ts` with `runBoundaryCheck(ctx)`; both `handlePreToolEdit` and the settle-time collector call it. **Note (pressure-test):** boundary is **not** in the `Gate` enum — it's a hook-time + settle-time anomaly check — so it lives in `checks/` alongside skill-audit (39.6), *outside* the Phase 44.1 registry.

**Depends on.** 39.1–39.7 (the `GateResult`/port pattern + `checks/` namespace established) and ideally 41.1 (commit seam).

**Files.**
- `packages/core/src/checks/boundary.ts` (new).
- `packages/core/src/hooks/handlers.ts` — `handlePreToolEdit` returns to dispatch + return shape.
- `packages/core/src/cli/commands/settle.ts` (or wherever `collectAnomalies` lives) — replace inline boundary check with `runBoundaryCheck(ctx)`.
- `packages/core/tests/checks/boundary.test.ts` (new) — tests target the check, not the hook.

**ACs.** (1) Boundary detection lives in one module under `checks/`. (2) Hook handler and settle-time path both call it — one rule, two emission points. (3) Hook handler shrinks to dispatch + check + return. (4) Tests target the check, not the hook. (5) Behavior bit-identical at both call sites.

### Phase 44.1 — Engine-driven gate registry (the hybrid endgame)

**Objective.** (Pressure-test addition — *registry endgame*.) With every enum gate now a discrete `GateImpl` module (39.1–39.7 + 39.2), convert settle's hand-wired `if (gateSet.gates.includes(X)) { runXGate(ctx) }` sequence into a single engine-driven dispatch: a `Record<Gate, GateImpl>` registry that settle drives by **iterating `effectiveGateSet(state, config, draft).gates`**. This makes `gates/engine.ts` load-bearing at runtime — *one* source of truth for both *which* gates fire and *in what order* — instead of the order living redundantly in settle's call sequence. `anomaly-notify` stays a `ctx.shouldNotify` flag consulted inside the impls (not a registry entry); `checks/` modules (skill-audit, boundary) stay explicitly dispatched, outside the registry.

**Depends on.** 39.1–39.7 + 39.2 (all 12 discrete enum-gate impls must exist and share the `GateImpl` shape).

**Files.**
- `packages/core/src/gates/registry.ts` (new) — `const GATE_REGISTRY: Record<Gate, GateImpl>` + a `runGates(ctx, gateSet)` driver that iterates `gateSet.gates` in order.
- `packages/core/src/cli/commands/settle.ts` — replace the hand-wired gate sequence with `runGates(ctx, gateSet)`.
- `packages/core/tests/gates/registry.test.ts` (new) — registry totality (every non-`anomaly-notify` `Gate` member has an entry, enforced at type level) + ordering preserved.

**ACs.** (1) `GATE_REGISTRY` is total over `Gate` minus `anomaly-notify` — missing an entry is a compile error (exhaustive `Record`). (2) Settle dispatches by walking a canonical **`GATE_ORDER: Gate[]`** constant intersected with `effectiveGateSet().gates`; no gate name is hardcoded in settle's control flow. (3) Firing order matches the pre-44.1 execution sequence (snapshot-tested). **Note (39.1 design, 2026-05-29):** matrix order (`[...ALWAYS_FIRE, ...deltas]`) ≠ execution order (settle runs deep-verify before code-review, draft-read before coverage), and the *first* refusing gate owns stderr+exit — so a `GATE_ORDER` constant is required; iterating `gateSet.gates` in array order is NOT behavior-preserving. (4) Adding a future gate = add an enum member + a `GATE_ORDER` entry + a registry entry; settle is untouched. (5) Behavior bit-identical at the CLI surface.

Entry point next session — **reconciled 2026-06-01** (this entry was badly stale: it said "start with Phase 39.1" when all of 39.1–44.1 had already shipped):

- **v1.2.0 Feature expansion** — ✓ SHIPPED (34.1–38.1).
- **v1.3.0 Architecture deepening** — ✓ SHIPPED. All of 39.1–44.1 landed on `main` 2026-05-29 (paired `docs(planning)` + `feat(core)` commits, full gate green at each); the registry endgame (44.1) is live in `settle.ts`. These shipped through the superpowers workflow **without the CADENCE settle ceremony**; the `.cadence/phases/39–44` artifacts were **backfilled 2026-06-01** (see `.cadence/RECONCILIATION-2026-06-01.md`).
- **v1.4.0 Public release** — ✓ SHIPPED 2026-06-02 (phase `45-public-release`). `@manehorizons/cadence-{core,types,host-claude-code}@1.4.0` published to npm via `release.yml` with provenance; annotated tag `v1.4.0` cut at the published commit. The earlier `1.1.1` (2026-05-30, bundled v1.2 + v1.3) is left as-is (fix-forward). See MILESTONES.md §v1.4.0.
- **v1.5.0 Session continuity** — ✓ SHIPPED 2026-06-03. `cadence handoff`/`resume` + `/cadence-handoff`/`/cadence-resume` (phase `46-handoff-resume`) and the boundary-check path-normalization fix (phase `47-boundary-path-fix`). `@manehorizons/cadence-{core,types,host-claude-code}@1.5.0` published to npm via `release.yml` with provenance; annotated tag `v1.5.0` cut at the published commit. See MILESTONES.md §v1.5.0.

All v1.1 work (29.x shakedown/remediation, 30.1 reversible publish proof, 31.1 docs, 32.1 test-infra, 32.2 lint, 33.1 publish) is shipped.

## v1.13.0 — Multi-host reach (Codex adapter) — ✓ SHIPPED 2026-06-06

Published to npm with SLSA provenance; annotated tag `v1.13.0` (`cd775ce`) cut at
the published commit. The first consumer of the phase-60 host-adapter contract: a
**fourth published package**, `@manehorizons/cadence-host-codex`, that `satisfies
HostAdapter` for the OpenAI Codex CLI — the contract held at **v1 unchanged** (a
differently-shaped host conformed without a bump, the portability proof). Built
across five phases, all settled + pushed:

- **Phase 65 — Codex adapter spike** ✓ — resolved the unknowns (command surface,
  `apply_patch` payload recoverability, non-TTY hook flow, event-map coverage);
  go on contract v1.
- **Phase 66 — adapter core** ✓ — package scaffold + `codexAdapter` with
  `mapEvent` over Codex's near-1:1 lifecycle and `extractPayload` parsing Codex's
  multi-file `apply_patch` envelope into `ExtractedPayload.files`.
- **Phase 67 — install surface** ✓ — `cadence-host-codex install` writes project
  `.codex/hooks.json` + **global** `~/.codex/prompts/` slash commands + the CLI.
- **Phase 68 — hook shim** ✓ — `cadence-host-codex hook`, the runtime shim from
  Codex's stdin-JSON lifecycle to the core dispatcher.
- **Phase 69 — docs** ✓ — Codex worked example in `host-adapters.md` + package
  README/LICENSE.

The other three public packages carried version-alignment bumps only. Full
scope/rationale/risks in MILESTONES.md §v1.13.0.

## v1.14.0 — Verifier correctness (deep-verify sees the code) — ✓ SHIPPED 2026-06-06

Decided 2026-06-06 (after OpenCode was rejected as the 3rd host adapter — rationale
in MILESTONES.md §Post-v1.0). **Keystone correctness fix:** the `deep-verify` gate
sent `diff: ''` to the AI verifier, so "deep verification" judged ACs on test-linkage
+ filenames only and never saw the implementation — even with a real provider. Both
phases settled; all four published packages bumped `1.13.0 → 1.14.0` in lockstep.

- **Phase 70 — diff wiring + cap + provenance** ✓ — `deep-verify.ts` now feeds the
  verifier the memoized `git diff HEAD` (shared with `code-review`) via the existing
  `ctx.diff()` (Phase 39.4 — pre-existed, so the keystone was simpler than planned),
  bounded by the new `verifier.diffCapBytes` config (default 256KB) + pure
  `capDiff()` helper with an honest `[diff truncated: N of M bytes]` marker; run-level
  `deepVerifyMeta` provenance written to the SUMMARY. (`per-task` verifier was already
  diff-aware — no blind spot.)
- **Phase 71 — banner honesty + docs + changeset** ✓ — mock-fallback banner re-gated
  on the gate's real firing condition (`--deep` **or** gate-set membership); docs
  (`concepts.md`, `config.md`, DESIGN.md **D12**) + doc-presence drift test; changeset
  for the lockstep bump.

Full scope/rationale in MILESTONES.md §v1.14.0.

## v1.15.0 — Verifier robustness (real providers, production-ready) — ✓ SHIPPED 2026-06-06

Chosen 2026-06-06 (the natural follow-on to v1.14, now that `deep-verify` actually sends
the diff). Make the **real** providers dependable in a settle gate, let the operator pick
one at the CLI, and make every run's token/cost auditable — the items deferred from
v1.14's scope guard. Provider hardening + ergonomics, **not** a verifier rewrite. All
phases settled; all four published packages bumped `1.14.0 → 1.15.0` in lockstep; full
scope/rationale/scope-guards in MILESTONES.md §v1.15.0.

- **Phase 72 — Provider hardening** ✓ — `anthropic` request `timeoutMs` + `maxRetries`
  (config-driven, via the pure `buildAnthropicClientConfig` seam); `local` bearer auth
  from `CADENCE_LOCAL_API_KEY` + `verifier.localHeaders` for OpenAI-compatible proxies.
  Tested via existing injected-client / transport seams; no live network.
- **Phase 73 — Selection + cost visibility** ✓ — `settle run --verifier
  <mock|anthropic|local>` (flag > config > default `mock`, validated, honest
  mock-fallback banner); optional token usage `{ inputTokens, outputTokens }` on
  `VerifyResult` → `deepVerifyMeta`/SUMMARY (extended the v1.14 `cadence-types` type).
- **Phase 74 — Release v1.15.0** ✓ — docs (`config.md` fields + auth env, `commands.md`
  `--verifier`, `providers.md` hardening/selection/cost) + changeset + lockstep
  `1.14.0 → 1.15.0` bump; **no new DESIGN.md D-number** (hardening + ergonomics, not a
  contract change). Tag + npm provenance via the manual `Release` workflow at publish.

Deferred candidate vectors (MILESTONES.md §Post-v1.0): observability (structured
logging / OTel), the **public launch** (assets staged local-only). No viable next
host adapter today (OpenCode rejected; Aider has no hooks).

---

## v1.16.0 — MCP surface deepening — ✓ SHIPPED 2026-06-07

Chosen 2026-06-07 (the leading Post-v1.0 candidate). Grow `cadence mcp serve` from a
thin tools-only slice (phase 58) into a full MCP integration along four dimensions —
adding the two missing MCP primitives (Resources, Prompts), widening the tool set to
the proven-out commands, and making setup paste-free. stdio-only and
imperative-surface-only still hold; DESIGN.md **D11** deepened additively (no new
D-number). All four published packages bumped `1.15.0 → 1.16.0` in lockstep. Design:
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-07-mcp-surface-deepening-design.md` (local-only).

- **Phase 75 — Resources** ✓ — `.cadence/` artifacts read-on-demand under a
  `cadence://` scheme (5 static + 2 templated phase resources); no subscriptions.
- **Phase 76 — Tool parity** ✓ — `cadence_handoff`, `cadence_resume`,
  `cadence_recommendation_add`, `cadence_recommendation_promote`, `cadence_doctor`
  (15 tools total), over thin services reusing existing core `run*` functions.
- **Phase 77 — Shared guidance + Prompts** ✓ — command prose + the scout dialogue
  extracted to a shared `cadence-types` module (host slash-command output
  byte-identical, golden-fixture–guarded); MCP prompts `cadence_scout` / `cadence_next`
  / `cadence_draft` / `cadence_settle`.
- **Phase 78 — Zero-config** ✓ — `cadence mcp install [--print] [--client <c>]`
  non-destructively writes/merges `.mcp.json` (idempotent; refuses malformed clobber).
- **Phase 79 — Release v1.16.0** ✓ — docs (`mcp.md`, `commands.md`), DESIGN.md D11
  extension, changeset, lockstep `1.15.0 → 1.16.0` bump. Tag + npm provenance via the
  manual `Release` workflow at publish.

Deferred candidate vectors (MILESTONES.md §Post-v1.0): observability (structured
logging / OTel), the **public launch** (assets staged local-only).

> **v1.17.0 – v1.23.0** (2026-06-07 → 06-11) shipped without separate ROADMAP
> sections — observability (v1.17), worktree safety (v1.18/v1.19), handoff-retention
> (v1.20), quickstart-onboarding (v1.21), verification-activation (v1.22), the
> phase-id ceiling fix (v1.22.1), and the phase-100 `shipped` terminal rec status

## v1.24.0 — Recommendation retention (manual + auto soft-archival) — ✓ SHIPPED 2026-06-11

All three phases settled + merged to `main` (PRs #77/#78/#79, CI green all 6 OS×Node
legs); all four published packages bumped `1.23.0 → 1.24.0` in lockstep (changeset
consumed). npm publish is the operator-triggered manual `Release` workflow. Full
narrative + the phase-102 CI dogfood note in MILESTONES.md §v1.24.0.

Direct follow-on to phase 100. `recommendations.json` is append-only; terminal recs
already hide from the active `recommend` surface but accumulate forever. Add manual +
automatic **soft-archival** (move-aside, recoverable) so the working ledger stays lean
while honoring phase 100's retain-as-provenance choice. Storage: a second `archived`
array in the same file (one atomic write moves a rec between arrays). Commands named
`archive`/`unarchive` (honest verb). Auto-archive (`recommendations.autoArchive`,
default **on**, recoverable): `shipped`/`rejected` immediately; `converted` when its
phase settles. **No new DESIGN.md D-number expected** (additive to the
recommendation-lifecycle model). Full scope/rationale/scope-guards in MILESTONES.md
§v1.24.0; design `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-11-recommendation-retention-design.md`.

- **Phase 101 — Archive core + manual commands** ✓ (PR #77) — `archived` array +
  `archivedAt` / `archiveReason` optional rec fields (`.default([])` keeps existing files
  valid); pure `archiveRecommendation` / `unarchiveRecommendation`;
  `runRecommendation{Archive,Unarchive}`; CLI `recommendation archive <id>` /
  `unarchive <id>` / `list --archived`. TDD. (Dropped the planned `--reason` flag — no
  free-text note field behind the `archiveReason` enum.)
- **Phase 102 — Auto-archive + config** ✓ (PR #78) — `recommendations.autoArchive`
  config; compose archival into the `shipped`/`rejected` status writes (atomic);
  best-effort settle→rec hook in `services/settle.ts` archiving a `converted` rec when its
  phase settles (never blocks settle, reported); `autoArchive` in the `config edit`
  catalog; archive-aware `recommendation show`. TDD.
- **Phase 103 — Release v1.24.0** ✓ (PR #79) — docs (`commands.md` archive/unarchive +
  `--archived`; `config.md` `recommendations` section), changeset, lockstep
  `1.23.0 → 1.24.0` across all four published packages. Tag + npm provenance via the
  manual `Release` workflow at publish.

## v1.26.0 — Guided onboarding: `cadence start` — ✓ DELIVERED 2026-06-13

All three phases settled through CADENCE's own loop on branch
`feat/v1.26-cadence-start`; all four published packages bumped `1.25.0 → 1.26.0`
in lockstep (changeset consumed, CLAUDE.md narrative leads with 1.26.0). npm publish
is the operator-triggered manual `Release` workflow. Built subagent-driven (implementer
+ two-stage spec/quality review per phase); the code-quality review caught a Windows-CI
portability bug pre-merge (`npx` via `child_process.spawn` needs `shell:true` on win32).

A newcomer faces several setup commands and must know which fits; the read-only
`cadence quickstart` prints a *map* but doesn't route or run anything. **`cadence start`**
is the interactive sibling: "What are you doing?" → numbered pick → confirm → runs the
matching command (tutorial, init, Claude Code / Codex host install, MCP install, doctor).
Dispatch is a uniform subprocess spawn (the `cadence` binary for core routes, `npx` for
the two host packages) — `start` never imports host code. Scriptable via
`--pick`/`--yes`/`--json`; non-TTY prints the menu and exits 0. **No new DESIGN.md
D-number** (additive onboarding/legibility). Full scope/scope-guards in MILESTONES.md
§v1.26.0; design `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-13-cadence-start-onboarding-design.md`.

- **Phase 105 — Pure core** ✓ — `START_OPTIONS` menu catalog (→ runner + args) +
  text/JSON/confirm renderers + `resolvePick`; no I/O. TDD (AC-1..AC-4).
- **Phase 106 — CLI shell + wiring** ✓ — `runStart` (pick/confirm/spawn dispatch,
  json/non-tty, error paths), `registerStartCommand`, a `start` entry in the `quickstart`
  command map, and a `cadence start` pointer in `init`'s next-steps output. TDD
  (AC-5..AC-13). Windows `npx`-spawn fix folded in.
- **Phase 107 — Release v1.26.0** ✓ — docs (`commands.md` `start` entry + README
  pointer), MILESTONES/ROADMAP narrative, changeset, lockstep `1.25.0 → 1.26.0` across
  all four published packages. Tag + npm provenance via the manual `Release` workflow at publish.

## v1.27.0 — Onboarding breeze: `init` is the front door — STARTED 2026-06-17

Chosen 2026-06-17 (direct follow-on to v1.26 `cadence start`). v1.26 made setup
*routable* — `start` points a newcomer at the right command. v1.27 makes the command
it points at *just work*: `cadence init` becomes a zero-friction front door that
scaffolds a working, real-verification-ready loop with no follow-up commands and no
prompts. Sourced from an onboarding assessment (2026-06-17) that walked install → first
successful loop and found ~8 typed steps + 1 hand-edit + a separate `activate` hop.
**No new DESIGN.md D-number** (additive onboarding/legibility, same lane as
`quickstart`/`start`/`activate`). Recs: rec-20260617-001/002/004 (accepted);
rec-20260617-003 (arg-syntax) + rec-20260617-005 (agent/non-TTY mode) deferred to a
v1.28 follow-on.

**Thesis.** The three init-hub recs cohere: each lands on `init.ts`, and together they
collapse "install → working real-verification loop" from ~8 steps + a hand-edit + a
separate activate into `cadence init` (auto-wired, demo phase, real verifier when a key
is present) → 3 paste-ready commands. The biggest breeze-per-effort of the five
findings.

### Phase 108 — Zero-prompt init that auto-wires the host (rec-20260617-001)

**Objective.** `cadence init` prompts for name (default `unnamed`) + profile, then tells
the user to *separately* run the host install. Make init derive everything: name from
`package.json`/dir, gate profile from git (the existing `suggestGateProfile` heuristic),
and — when a Claude Code workspace is detected (`.claude/` present) — offer (or, with a
flag, auto-run) `cadence-host-claude-code install` in the same step. `--name`/`--preset`/
`--gate-profile` stay as explicit overrides. One command, zero questions, fully wired.

**Files.**
- `packages/core/src/cli/commands/init.ts` — name/profile auto-derivation; host-wire step.
- `packages/host-claude-code/src/install.ts` — reusable install entrypoint init can invoke (or a spawn, mirroring `start`'s launcher discipline — core must not import host code).
- `packages/core/tests/cli/init.test.ts` — auto-derive + host-wire coverage.

**ACs.** (1) `init` with no flags writes a valid `.cadence/` with a derived name (no
`unnamed`) and a git-suggested gate profile, asking nothing. (2) `--name`/`--preset`/
`--gate-profile` still override the derivations. (3) When `.claude/` is present, init
offers/auto-runs the host install without core importing host code (spawn seam, like
`start`). (4) Non-TTY runs never block (no prompt path reachable). (5) Behavior for an
already-initialized dir unchanged (still refuses / `--claude-md` path intact).

### Phase 109 — `init --demo`: a pre-filled first phase in the real repo (rec-20260617-002)

**Objective.** `cadence tutorial` runs in a throwaway sandbox then deletes it — the user
ends with nothing, and the README quickstart's "fill `.cadence/phases/.../DRAFT.md`" is
the steepest step in the happy path. Add `cadence init --demo` (or a `start` route) that
scaffolds a real phase with the objective + AC-1 + task T1 **already written** (reuse the
`tutorial` toy template), so the user runs `approve → done → settle` immediately and
watches a real gate fire/pass **in their own repo**.

**Files.**
- `packages/core/src/cli/commands/init.ts` — `--demo` flag → scaffold the seeded phase.
- `packages/core/src/cli/commands/tutorial.ts` — extract the shared toy-DRAFT template.
- `packages/core/tests/cli/init-demo.test.ts` (new).

**ACs.** (1) `cadence init --demo` leaves a ready-to-approve phase DRAFT in the real
`.cadence/`. (2) The seeded DRAFT carries objective + ≥1 AC + ≥1 task (no hand-edit
needed to reach settle). (3) The toy template is shared with `tutorial` (one source).
(4) `init` without `--demo` is unchanged. (5) The seeded loop runs `approve → done →
settle` clean end-to-end (tested).

### Phase 110 — Fold activation into init when a key is present (rec-20260617-004)

**Objective.** The `mock` verifier is named "NOT real verification" across
init/doctor/config-explain, but turning it on is a *separate* `cadence activate` +
`export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` dance. At init, if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is already in the env,
offer (or `--activate` auto-select) the `anthropic` provider right there — reusing the
`activate` plan/assess seam (no key persisted). A user who already has a key gets real
verification with zero extra hops and no scolding.

**Files.**
- `packages/core/src/cli/commands/init.ts` — env probe + `--activate`; reuse activate seam.
- `packages/core/src/cli/commands/activate.ts` (or `activate/*`) — shared provider-write seam.
- `packages/core/tests/cli/init-activate.test.ts` (new).

**ACs.** (1) With `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set, `init --activate` writes `verifier.provider =
anthropic` (deep-verify seam) without persisting the key. (2) Without the key (or without
`--activate`), init stays on `mock` and prints the existing activate pointer. (3) The
provider-write reuses the `activate` seam (no duplicated logic). (4) Non-TTY safe. (5) The
mock-NOT-real-verification notice is suppressed when real verification was just wired.

### Phase 111 — Release v1.27.0

**Objective.** Docs (`commands.md` init flags `--demo`/`--activate` + the auto-wire
behavior; README quickstart collapsed to the new flow; `providers.md`/`concepts.md`
touch-ups), changeset, lockstep `1.26.0 → 1.27.0` across all four published packages.
Tag + npm provenance via the manual `Release` workflow at publish.

**ACs.** (1) README quickstart reflects the zero-prompt / `--demo` / key-aware flow.
(2) `commands.md` documents the new init flags. (3) Changeset present; all four packages
bumped in lockstep. (4) Full suite green. (5) CLAUDE.md narrative leads with `1.27.0`.

**Scope guards.** *In:* the init-hub trio (auto-derive + host-wire, `--demo`, key-aware
activate) + docs + release. *Out (deferred to v1.28):* rec-003 (auto-derive phase id +
`--ac` syntax shorthands) and rec-005 (agent/non-TTY mode + `--preset agent`). *Out
(YAGNI):* a full interactive init wizard; remembering host choices; non-Anthropic
key-detection at init.

## Backfilled: phases 118–230 (2026-06-18 – 2026-07-27)

The following sections were backfilled 2026-07-27, closing a gap where `.cadence/phases/`
kept advancing (through phase 230) without ROADMAP.md/MILESTONES.md being updated to
match, following the shipped-version retrospective convention this repo already uses for
delivered milestones (see Phase 111 and earlier). Each backfilled phase's own settled
artifacts under `.cadence/phases/<N>-<slug>/` are the record and were not modified by this
backfill — these sections are an index into that record, not a replacement for it.

## v1.30.0 – v1.32.0 — Hardening pass, draft/settle ergonomics, and release integrity — ✓ SHIPPED 2026-06-18 → 06-23

*Backfilled 2026-07-27 from the settled artifacts under `.cadence/phases/118–129`. None of
these tags has a dedicated release phase, so the phase→version attribution below is
**date-derived** (settle date vs tag date) and is approximate at the boundaries.*

| tag | tagged | phases attributed (date-derived) |
|---|---|---|
| v1.30.0 | 2026-06-18 | 118–122 |
| v1.31.0 | 2026-06-19 | 123 |
| v1.32.0 | 2026-06-23 | 124, 129 |

This arc opens with phase 118, a hardening review that turns prior review findings into
fail-closed behavior: centralized phase-slug validation before every filesystem join (path
traversal refusal), `execFileSync` argv git diff collection replacing shell-string
interpolation (metacharacter injection), config loading that refuses invalid
`.cadence/config.json` instead of silently falling back to defaults, and a docs pass
reconciling README/DESIGN with the shipped (not archived) Codex adapter. The next phases are a
DX pass on the loop's day-to-day surface: 119 lets `draft new` derive its own phase/task id and
adds `--pass-all`/`--ac-pass` settle shorthands; 120 makes gate bypasses durably auditable — a
`SUMMARY.json` `gateBypasses` array, a rendered Markdown section, and a loud settle-time stderr
warning, closing a silent-bypass gap; 121 is a local-only, gitignored, sourced
competitive-positioning note for launch prep with deliberately narrow claims; 122 closes the
remaining Codex host-adapter test-parity gaps (local hook install roundtrip, prompts sourced
from the shared `COMMAND_GUIDANCE`/`SCOUT_DIALOGUE` catalog). Phase 123 adds first-real-work
DRAFT templates (`bugfix`/`feature`/`refactor`) to `draft new` so a newcomer's first real phase
doesn't require hand-authoring Objective/AC/Tasks/Boundaries from scratch. Phase 124 hardens the
release process itself: `scripts/release-integrity.mjs` creates/updates the GitHub Release for
the published tag and verifies npm+tag+GitHub-Release agreement across every public package,
failing loudly on mismatch instead of leaving an `untagged-*` draft. Phase 129, after the
numbering gap, rebuilds `cadence tutorial` around a genuine refuse→fix→pass arc — the demo
stages an unbacked AC-1 claim, lets settle's `test-coverage` gate really refuse it, then adds a
real test and genuinely passes, making the refusal itself the tutorial's money moment, with zero
engine changes. **No new DESIGN.md D-number** across this arc — all eight phases are additive to
existing models (path/config safety, the draft/settle CLI surface, the Codex adapter, the
release pipeline, the tutorial).

- **Phase 118 — hardening review: fail-closed config, path-safe phases, shell-safe diffs** ✓ —
  centralized phase-slug validation before filesystem joins across draft/spec approve/new,
  settle, and MCP resource reads; replaced shell-string git diff collection with `execFileSync`
  argv execution (regression-tested against shell-metacharacter filenames); invalid
  `.cadence/config.json` now fails closed instead of falling back to defaults; reconciled
  README/docs/DESIGN with the shipped Codex adapter; full local lint/typecheck/test/build gate
  green.
- **Phase 119 — auto-derived phase id + settle pass shorthands** ✓ — `cadence draft new --title
  "..."` (positionals omitted) now derives the next-free phase slug and task id `01` itself;
  added `--pass-all` and `--ac-pass <id...>` settle shorthands so ACs can be marked PASS without
  the `AC-1=pass` syntax; `cadence progress` prints the simplified command. Existing explicit
  `draft new <phase> <num>` and `--ac AC-1=pass` paths stay compatible.
- **Phase 120 — loud bypass audit trail** ✓ — settle now records an optional `gateBypasses`
  array in `SUMMARY.json` (gate, flag, reason), renders a `## Gate bypasses` section in
  `SUMMARY.md`, and prints a `settle bypass [...]` stderr warning for each recorded bypass; clean
  settles are unaffected — `gateBypasses` stays absent and the section is omitted.
- **Phase 121 — competitive objection FAQ** ✓ — local-only, gitignored `COMPETITIVE.md`
  launch-prep note: sourced positioning against Spec Kit, OpenSpec, BMad Method, CodeRabbit,
  Greptile, Qodo, Graphite, and Thoughtworks Radar, a narrow in-loop-enforcement wedge claim, an
  objection FAQ, and an explicit "overclaims to avoid" section.
- **Phase 122 — Codex host adapter parity tests** ✓ — added Codex-equivalent local hook install
  roundtrip coverage (`.codex/hooks.json` through the local shim) and re-sourced Codex prompt
  prose from the shared `COMMAND_GUIDANCE`/`SCOUT_DIALOGUE` catalog (including `cadence-scout`),
  with parity tests locking prompts to Codex-shaped frontmatter (no Claude `allowed-tools`/
  autorun line).
- **Phase 123 — draft templates for first real work** ✓ — `cadence draft new --template
  <bugfix|feature|refactor>` renders a deterministic, non-placeholder Objective/AC/Tasks/
  Boundaries body for a newcomer's first real DRAFT; validated against unknown template names
  (refuses before writing) and against existing no-template/explicit-phase-id behavior; README/
  quickstart/command reference document the first-real-phase command and that templates are
  scaffolds to edit, not proof of correctness.
- **Phase 124 — release integrity: GitHub releases stay in sync** ✓ — new
  `scripts/release-integrity.mjs` discovers public packages, validates lockstep versions,
  extracts the `packages/core/CHANGELOG.md` entry, and creates/updates the GitHub Release for the
  pushed tag; the Release workflow runs it post-tag with `GH_TOKEN`/`NODE_AUTH_TOKEN`, failing
  loudly (naming the mismatched package/tag/release) instead of leaving an `untagged-*` draft;
  `docs/release.md` now defines "done" as npm + tag + GitHub Release + latest marker all
  agreeing.
- **Phase 129 — rebuild tutorial around the catch (refuse→fix→pass)** ✓ — `cadence tutorial` now
  stages an unbacked AC-1 claim, lets `settle run --auto` genuinely refuse it (`test-coverage`
  names AC-1, loop stays in BUILD), then adds a real `sum.test.mjs` and genuinely passes to IDLE
  with a SUMMARY; the refusal renders as a visually distinct banner; no `--ac` manual assertion
  or coverage-bypass flag anywhere in the tutorial path; zero engine changes.

*(Phases 125–128 were never used — see the numbering ledger.)*

## v1.33.0 – v1.36.0 — Onboarding trust: agent-prompt, doctor repairs, dry-run preview, and the onboarding-honesty wave — ✓ SHIPPED 2026-06-25 → 07-01

*Backfilled 2026-07-27 from the settled artifacts under `.cadence/phases/130–139`. None of
these tags has a dedicated release phase inside this arc, so the phase→version attribution
below is **date-derived** (settle date vs tag date) and is approximate at the boundaries.*

| tag | tagged | phases attributed (date-derived) |
|---|---|---|
| v1.33.0 | 2026-06-25 | 130 |
| v1.34.0 | 2026-06-26 | 131 |
| v1.35.0 | 2026-06-26 | 132 |
| v1.36.0 | 2026-07-01 | 133–139 |

This arc runs two related campaigns back to back. Phases 130–132 build the first-run trust
surfaces that let a new adopter see what CADENCE will do before it does it: `cadence
agent-prompt` (a copy-paste prompt that hands a fresh user's AI agent the DRAFT-then-stop
workflow, backed by one pure `renderAgentPrompt` shared by the command and `init`'s output),
`doctor --fix`/`--wire-host`/`--dry-run` (best-effort auto-repair of onboarding drift —
git-hooks, STATE.md, host install — classified `auto`/`wire-host`/`manual` via a pure
`planFixes`), and `init --dry-run` (a pure `planInit` → `InitPlan` that resolves everything a
real init would and prints a fit-check preview without writing anything, so `init` can be run
safely inside a populated repo). Phases 133–139 are a different shape of work: they are the
direct fix set from an onboarding-honesty audit (the `rec-20260701-00x` series, findings
F2/F4/F5/F6/F9/F10), shipped together as v1.36.0 ("onboarding-honesty wave 1"). Each phase
closes one concrete gap between what CADENCE claims about itself and what it actually does —
`doctor`'s git-hooks check flagging a directory that was never there, `cadence progress`
lacking `--json`, `init --demo` printing next-step blocks that immediately refuse because a
demo phase is already open, the README's real-phase walkthrough missing an inline
`--no-approve` pointer, three surfaces breaking the "always name a concrete next move" pattern,
and a slash-command count published inconsistently across four docs. Phase 139 is the
capstone and the largest single change in the arc: it flips the default `coverageMode` from
`mention` to `assertion` for all three presets, derives a real `verification.testCommand` from
the target repo's `package.json#scripts.test` + detected package manager, and makes
`build-test-must-pass` print a loud stderr notice instead of passing silently when no test
command is configured — closing the gap between what `cadence tutorial` demonstrates
(real enforcement) and what a fresh `init` actually delivered. All published packages moved in
lockstep across the four tags. **No new DESIGN.md D-number** in this window (git history on
`DESIGN.md` has no commits in the 06-24 → 07-02 range).

- **Phase 130 — `cadence agent-prompt` + init block** ✓ — pure `renderAgentPrompt(goal?)`
  substitutes a supplied goal or falls back to `<your goal>`; the `agent-prompt` CLI command
  and a new "Hand it to your AI agent" block in `init`'s output share the same renderer so they
  cannot drift; the prompt teaches `cadence draft new --template`, AC tagging, and explicitly
  tells the agent to stop before `draft approve`.
- **Phase 131 — `doctor --fix`/`--wire-host`/`--dry-run`** ✓ (rec-20260619-004) — a pure
  `planFixes(report)` classifies each non-ok doctor finding as `auto`/`wire-host`/`manual`;
  `applyFixes` best-effort-repairs git-hooks (via `git config`) and STATE.md
  (`renderStateMd`), host wiring is gated behind `--wire-host` and deduped by fix id, and
  `--dry-run` previews without writing.
- **Phase 132 — `init --dry-run` fit-check preview** ✓ (rec-20260619-005) — a pure
  `planInit(cwd, opts, env)` composes the existing resolution helpers (`deriveName`,
  `detectTestGlobs`, gate-profile suggestion, preset/activation/host decisions) into an
  inspectable `InitPlan`; `--dry-run` short-circuits before any write and prints the rendered
  plan, including on an already-`.cadence/`-initialized repo (previews instead of refusing).
  Real write path left byte-for-byte unchanged.
- **Phase 133 — doctor git-hooks check: verify dir before flagging/fixing** ✓
  (rec-20260701-002, F2) — a missing `.githooks/` directory now reports not-applicable
  instead of `warning`, and `--fix` never overwrites a pre-existing custom `core.hooksPath`
  (e.g. a Husky `.husky` setup); happy path unchanged.
- **Phase 134 — `cadence progress --json`** ✓ (rec-20260701-004, F4) — mirrors
  `recommendService`'s `--json` pattern, emitting the same structured `{ command, reason }`
  payload the service already returns instead of requiring callers to regex the rendered text.
- **Phase 135 — `init --demo`: suppress conflicting next-step blocks** ✓ (rec-20260701-005,
  F5) — the generic "Your first loop" and "Hand it to your AI agent" blocks (both of which
  immediately refuse with `loopPosition is DRAFT` when a demo phase is already open) are
  suppressed when `--demo` seeded a phase; the "Demo phase ready" (approve → done → settle)
  block still prints unchanged.
- **Phase 136 — README real-phase example: inline `--no-approve` pointer** ✓
  (rec-20260701-006, F6) — investigation found the agent-prompt side of this finding already
  fixed in phase 130; the remaining gap was the README's "drive a real phase yourself"
  walkthrough showing a bare `draft approve` with no inline pointer to `--no-approve` for the
  non-interactive/CI/agent case, now added.
- **Phase 137 — Refusal trio: concrete next-move everywhere** ✓ (rec-20260701-007, F10) —
  three fixes: BUILD-state `cadence progress` now names the actual first-pending task id (or
  `settle run --auto`) instead of an unrunnable compound OR command; `draft approve` on a
  missing DRAFT.md gives a clean guarded refusal (mirroring `spec approve`) instead of a raw
  ENOENT; `settle run` out of position now names the actual next step via the same
  `nextAction()` `cadence progress` uses.
- **Phase 138 — Docs truth pass: slash-command counts + start menu completeness** ✓
  (rec-20260701-011, F9–F10) — reconciled the slash-command count to code truth (12) across
  README, quickstart, and claude-code.md (including a broken TOC anchor); added the 3 missing
  commands to quickstart's table; added a 7th `cadence start` menu option ("Turn on real
  verification" → `cadence activate`) so the guided front door reaches the remedy its own
  mock-verifier banner recommends by name. The README flagship-walkthrough claim in the same
  rec was live-tested and found already accurate — scoped out, no change needed.
- **Phase 139 — Default install enforces what the tutorial demonstrates** ✓
  (rec-20260701-001, wave 2, "enforcement wedge") — flips `verification.coverageMode` to
  `'assertion'` by default for all three presets (`solo`/`team`/`production`); adds a pure
  `detectTestCommand` helper (covers all 4 lockfile types + no-lockfile/no-scripts fallbacks)
  wired into both `InitPlan` and the real `init.ts` write path; `build-test-must-pass` prints a
  new `NO_TEST_COMMAND_NOTICE` via `ctx.io.err` instead of passing silently when no test
  command is configured. Existing `.cadence/config.json` files are untouched — the flip only
  applies to new inits.

- **Scope guards (as built).** *In:* the full agent-prompt/doctor-fix/dry-run trust surfaces
  (130–132) and the complete onboarding-honesty wave-1 fix set (133–139, all six audit
  findings plus the enforcement-default flip). *Out:* `--host` variants or host
  auto-detection in the agent prompt; refactoring `init`'s real write path to consume
  `planInit`; `cadence init --json`; a `cadence explain` start-menu option (phase 138 noted no
  equivalent forcing function existed, deferred); rec-003 (SUMMARY provenance) and rec-009
  (sealed gates), explicitly called out in phase 139's DRAFT as separate, later phases.

## v1.37.0 – v1.38.0 — SUMMARY gate provenance + sealed production gates — ✓ SHIPPED 2026-07-02 → 07-03

*Backfilled 2026-07-27 from the settled artifacts under `.cadence/phases/140–141`; those
artifacts are the record and were not modified. Phase 140's attribution to v1.37.0 is
**evidenced** (named explicitly in the v1.37.0 release commit and `packages/core/CHANGELOG.md`).
Phase 141's attribution to v1.38.0 is **date-derived**: its merge commit (`f9205d16`, PR #123)
landed 2026-07-02 20:28 (-0500), after the v1.37.0 tag (18:09 same day) and before the v1.38.0
tag (2026-07-03 13:58) — but phase 141 shipped without its own changeset, so `gates.sealed`
never appears in either release's CHANGELOG prose; v1.38.0's changelog entry names only phases
142–144.*

| tag | tagged | phases attributed |
|---|---|---|
| v1.37.0 | 2026-07-02 | 140 (evidenced) |
| v1.38.0 | 2026-07-03 | 141 (date-derived; undocumented in changelog) |

This arc closes the three-recommendation "enforcement-wedge wave 2" trio the operator opened
with rec-20260701-001/-003/-009 — three separate gaps in the settle loop's honesty story.
Phase 140 makes a settle's PASS verdicts auditable: `SUMMARY.json`'s new `gates[]` array records
per-gate `ran`/`skipped` (+ reason) provenance for all 8 settle-dispatched gates in
`GATE_ORDER`, each `acResults[]` row carries a per-AC `evidence` class (`ai-verified` /
`executed` / `assertion` / `mention` / `unverified`) derived by a new pure
`gates/ac-evidence.ts`, and a mock-provider deep-verify is now structurally prevented from ever
reporting `ai-verified`; `SUMMARY.md` renders both a `## Gate provenance` section and per-AC
evidence tags, and pre-phase SUMMARY records stay parseable. v1.37.0's own release commit
titled itself "enforcement-wedge wave 2 (**partial**)" — phase 141, the trio's third leg, was
still in flight at cut time. Phase 141 finishes it: the `production` gate-profile preset now
seals `test-coverage` and `build-test-must-pass` via a new `gates.sealed: string[]` config
field, and both gates refuse `--force`/their own `--allow-*` flag outright when sealed, with a
refusal message that names `gates.sealed`. The phase's own follow-up commit records that
shipping it closed "wave 2's enforcement-wedge trio (001/003/009 all shipped now)." No new
DESIGN.md D-number resulted from either phase.

- **Phase 140 — SUMMARY gate provenance** ✓ (rec-20260701-003) — `SUMMARY.json`'s `gates[]`
  array records ran/skipped(+reason) provenance for all 8 settle-dispatched gates in
  `GATE_ORDER`; `acResults[]` rows carry a derived `evidence` class; mock-provider deep-verify
  never yields `ai-verified` (it falls through to that AC's test-coverage evidence instead);
  `SUMMARY.md` renders the new `## Gate provenance` section plus per-AC evidence tags; pre-phase
  SUMMARY records without the new fields still parse and render unchanged.
- **Phase 141 — sealed gates: production preset makes named gates non-bypassable** ✓
  (rec-20260701-009) — new `gates.sealed: string[]` config field (defaults `[]`, backward
  compatible); the `production` preset sets it to `['test-coverage', 'build-test-must-pass']`
  (`solo`/`team` presets unchanged, stay `[]`); a shared `isGateSealed(ctx, gateId)` predicate
  makes both `coverage.ts` and `build-test-must-pass.ts` ignore `--force` and their per-gate
  `--allow-*` flag when sealed, refusing with a message that names `gates.sealed`; unsealed
  bypass behavior (and its bypass-notice logging) is byte-for-byte unchanged.

- **Scope guards (as built).** *In:* per-gate/per-AC provenance rendering and evidence-class
  derivation (140); the `gates.sealed` non-bypass mechanism, scoped to exactly `test-coverage`
  and `build-test-must-pass` on the `production` preset only (141). *Out:* sealing any gate
  besides those two, changing what makes either gate refuse in the first place, or touching the
  `solo`/`team` presets' bypass posture — all three explicitly excluded in phase 141's
  Boundaries.

## v1.38.0 – v1.39.0 — Cross-worktree handoff picker + intelligence-ledger lifecycle — ✓ SHIPPED 2026-07-03

*Backfilled 2026-07-27 from the settled artifacts under `.cadence/phases/142–149`; those artifacts
are the record and were not modified.*

| tag | tagged | phases attributed |
|---|---|---|
| v1.38.0 | 2026-07-03 | 142–144 (**evidenced** — phase 144 is the release phase) |
| v1.39.0 | 2026-07-03 | 145–149 (date-derived) |

This arc closes two adjacent but distinct milestones on the same day. Phases 142–144 finish the
cross-worktree handoff-picker line: 142 extracts the git-worktree-discovery plumbing the
phase-collision guard already used (`parseWorktreePorcelain`, `normalizeWorktreePath`,
`isSameWorktree`, `worktreeKey`) into a shared `packages/core/src/git/worktrees.ts` module and adds
a new best-effort `gatherHandoffCandidates` primitive that live-scans local + sibling worktrees for
resumable handoff docs, ranked freshest-first — deliberately no cached index, the same
"observe ground truth" philosophy the collision guard already locked in; 143 wires that primitive
into `cadence resume`'s CLI/service layer as an opt-in picker (`--list`/`--pick <n>`/`--path <p>`/
`--local`, a `resume` config block, a strictly read-only sibling-resume path) while keeping
single-worktree output byte-identical to pre-phase-143; 144 documents the full surface across
commands.md/config.md/concepts.md, appends a DESIGN.md §13 addendum (explicitly no new D-number —
this is a sibling application of §13's locked "ground truth, not a registry" decision, extended
from phase numbers to handoff docs), and cuts the v1.38.0 lockstep release. Phases 145–149 then
work through a batch of intelligence-ledger and CLI-ergonomics fixes that landed against the
already-tagged v1.39.0 with no dedicated release phase of their own: 145 stops a settled phase's
`converted` recommendation from silently vanishing into `ledger.archived`, routing it through a new
visible `settle-pending` status instead (surfaced by `cadence doctor`/`cadence progress`, promotable
only to `shipped`); 146 adds `--top <n>` truncation to `cadence recommend` plus a
`/cadence-recommend` slash command for both hosts as a lightweight front door; 147 fixes issue
#129 — the collision guard matched upstream occupancies on phase number alone, so a phase's own
already-pushed SPEC/DRAFT reflected back from `origin` looked like a foreign conflict on the very
next `draft new`/`settle run` — by exempting an upstream occupancy only when its full directory name
(number + slug) exactly matches a local occupancy's, leaving sibling matching and genuinely
different same-numbered upstream phases unaffected; 148 and 149 are direct follow-ons that 145's own
boundaries explicitly deferred to "a later phase in this arc" — `settle run --ship-ref <text>`
(issue #134) promotes a converted recommendation straight to `shipped` instead of the default
settle-pending advance, and `cadence milestone close <id>` (issue #135) gives an `exported`
milestone a `closed` terminal status with a non-blocking advisory on unshipped members. No new
DESIGN.md D-number resulted from either half of this arc.

- **Phase 142 — worktree-discovery extraction + handoff-candidate core** ✓ — extracted the
  phase-collision guard's git-worktree-discovery plumbing into `packages/core/src/git/worktrees.ts`,
  rewired `occupancy.ts` onto it with zero behavior change (regression-guarded by its own unmodified
  test file), and added the unwired `gatherHandoffCandidates` primitive consumed starting phase 143.
- **Phase 143 — CLI/service integration + picker for `cadence resume`** ✓ — wired
  `gatherHandoffCandidates` into `cadence resume`: `--list`/`--pick`/`--path`/`--local` flags, a
  `resume` config block (`crossWorktree` default true, `autoList` default false), a TTY-aware
  picker, and a hard-invariant read-only sibling-resume path (no `lastHandoff` stamp, no writes to a
  foreign `.cadence/`, `context: null` on `--full` for a sibling pick).
- **Phase 144 — docs + release for cross-worktree handoff picker (v1.38.0)** ✓ — documented the
  full `resume` flag surface in commands.md, a new `## resume` section in config.md, a
  concepts.md addendum, and a DESIGN.md §13 addendum; cut the v1.38.0 lockstep release across all
  four published packages.
- **Phase 145 — settle-pending recommendation status** ✓ — a settling phase's `converted`
  recommendation now transitions to a visible `settle-pending` status instead of being archived;
  `settle-pending → shipped` is the only sanctioned promotion; `cadence doctor`/`cadence progress`
  surface pending-ship recs with the exact promote command.
- **Phase 146 — `cadence recommend --top <n>` + `/cadence-recommend` slash command** ✓ — core
  truncation logic (`report.totals.ranked` still reports the pre-truncation count), a renderer
  truncation note, the CLI flag, and a new `/cadence-recommend` slash command for both hosts
  (auto-run `cadence recommend --top 5`), bumping Claude Code's installed-command count 12→13.
- **Phase 147 — upstream self-authorship exemption for the phase-collision guard** ✓ (issue #129)
  — exempts an `upstream` occupancy from conflicting only when its full directory name (number +
  slug) exactly matches a `local` occupancy's name at the same number; a differently-named upstream
  phase at the same number, and any `sibling` occupancy, still conflicts as before.
- **Phase 148 — `settle run --ship-ref` shortcut** ✓ (issue #134) — opt-in `--ship-ref <text>`
  promotes a settling phase's `converted` recommendation straight to `shipped` (setting
  `shippedRef`), reusing the existing tested `converted → shipped` transition; omitting the flag
  leaves settle's default behavior unchanged.
- **Phase 149 — `cadence milestone close <id>` verb** ✓ (issue #135) — new transition (legal only
  from `exported`) moves a milestone to `closed`, with an optional `--ref <text>` stored as
  `closedRef` and rendered in MILESTONES.md's "## Closed" section; closing warns but does not block
  on any linked recommendation that isn't yet `shipped`.

- **Scope guards (as built).** *In:* cross-worktree handoff discovery + picker + docs + release
  (v1.38.0); settle-pending ledger status, `recommend --top` + slash command, the collision-guard
  self-match fix, the `--ship-ref` shortcut, and the milestone `close` verb (v1.39.0). *Out:* phase
  143 left `cadence handoff`'s write path/retention pruning untouched; phase 145's boundaries
  explicitly deferred both the `--ship-ref` flag and any `cadence milestone` command changes to
  "a later phase in this arc" — fulfilled by 148 and 149 respectively; phase 149 explicitly declined
  a `milestone reopen`/`unclose` verb as not requested by its source issue.

## v1.40.0 – v1.41.0 — AC-ref parser fix, structured draft editing, MCP intelligence-lifecycle parity — ✓ SHIPPED 2026-07-04 → 07-04

*Backfilled 2026-07-27 from the settled artifacts under `.cadence/phases/150–154`; those
artifacts are the record and were not modified. Phase→version boundaries **evidenced**
(phase 152 is the release phase for v1.40.0, phase 154 for v1.41.0 — both tags shipped the same
day).*

| tag | tagged | phases attributed |
|---|---|---|
| v1.40.0 | 2026-07-04 | 150–152 (**evidenced** — phase 152 is the release phase) |
| v1.41.0 | 2026-07-04 | 153–154 (**evidenced** — phase 154 is the release phase) |

Two same-day releases closing out a legibility bug and opening a structured write path. Phase
150 was found while dogfooding phase 149 (issue #135): `status.ts` and `notify/collect.ts` each
carried a byte-identical private `parseAcRefs(done: string)` whose exact-match regex
(`/^AC-\d+$/`) silently dropped any comma-token with trailing annotation text — e.g. `done: AC-1,
AC-2, AC-3, AC-4 (core logic)` parsed to only three ids, leaving AC-4 stuck `pending` with no
diagnostic pointing at the real cause. The fix de-duplicated both private copies into one shared,
tested `packages/core/src/parse/ac-refs.ts` using a per-token prefix match. Phase 151 is the
larger piece: three new additive `cadence draft` subcommands (`set-objective`, `add-ac`,
`add-task`) that mutate a PENDING `DRAFT.md`'s sections from the CLI, round-tripping byte-exactly
through `parseDraftMd`/`renderDraftBody` — hand-editing stays fully supported, this just closes
the class of bug where a hand-typed heading typo silently corrupts AC/task id sequencing. Phase
152 released v1.40.0, documenting the three subcommands in `commands.md` and bundling phases
139-151. The second half of the arc, phase 153, closes MCP tool-parity gaps in the
scout-to-phase intelligence lifecycle: an MCP-only client could add or promote a recommendation
but not convert it to a phase, propose a milestone, or archive it. Three new thin-wrapper tools
(`cadence_recommendation_convert`, `cadence_milestone_propose`, `cadence_recommendation_archive`)
plus a `cadence://phase/{phase}/summary.json` resource close that gap, and the
`cadence_recommendation_promote` tool description was rewritten to point at the two new tools
instead of a CLI-only dead end. Phase 154 released v1.41.0, documenting the additions in
`docs/mcp.md` and bumping the advertised tool count from 15 to 18. All four published packages
bumped `1.39.0 → 1.40.0 → 1.41.0` in lockstep across the two releases. **No new DESIGN.md
D-number** in either version (both additive to existing models: the draft-parsing model and the
D11 MCP imperative-loop surface).

- **Phase 150 — AC-ref parser drops ids after trailing annotation** ✓ — deduplicated the
  byte-identical private `parseAcRefs` from `status.ts` and `notify/collect.ts` into a shared
  `packages/core/src/parse/ac-refs.ts` using a per-token prefix match instead of the exact
  whole-token match, so a trailing annotation after a valid `AC-N` id no longer silently drops it.
- **Phase 151 — structured draft editing: `draft add-ac` / `add-task` / `set-objective`** ✓ —
  three additive CLI subcommands that mutate a PENDING `DRAFT.md`'s Objective/AC/Tasks sections,
  round-tripping byte-exactly through `parseDraftMd`; `add-task --done` refuses on an unknown AC
  id, all three refuse outside `PENDING` status.
- **Phase 152 — Release v1.40.0** ✓ — documented the three phase-151 subcommands in
  `docs/reference/commands.md`; lockstep `1.39.0 → 1.40.0` across all four published packages;
  bundled phases 139-151.
- **Phase 153 — MCP parity for the intelligence lifecycle** ✓ — added
  `cadence_recommendation_convert`, `cadence_milestone_propose`, `cadence_recommendation_archive`
  as thin wrappers over the existing service/store functions, a `summary.json` MCP resource, and
  rewrote the `cadence_recommendation_promote` description to name the two new tools as real
  next steps.
- **Phase 154 — Release v1.41.0** ✓ — documented phase 153's three tools + resource in
  `docs/mcp.md` (tool count 15 → 18); lockstep `1.40.0 → 1.41.0` across all four published
  packages.

- **Scope guards (as built).** *In:* the AC-ref parser fix, the three structured-draft-editing
  subcommands, the two release cuts, the three MCP intelligence-lifecycle tools, the
  SUMMARY.json resource, the promote-description fix. *Out:* phase 153 explicitly declined
  `cadence_recommendation_unarchive` and `cadence_milestone_accept/defer/export` MCP tools —
  out of scope per rec-20260701-010's stated fix list, left as a follow-up recommendation if more
  parity is wanted later.

## v1.42.0 — Boundary enforcement + subagent dispatch — ✓ SHIPPED 2026-07-06

*Backfilled 2026-07-27 from the settled artifacts under `.cadence/phases/155–160`; those
artifacts are the record and were not modified. Phase→version boundaries **evidenced**
(phase 160 is the release phase for this tag).*

`boundaryEnforcement` shipped warn-only: the pre-tool hook could see an edit land outside
the DRAFT's declared `files:` and say so, but nothing refused, and settle never
re-derived the violation from the diff — so a boundary was a suggestion at the moment it
mattered most, the completion claim. This milestone closes both ends. The dispatch work
is the other half of the same session-discipline problem: `cadence dispatch plan` turns
the approved DRAFT's `depends:` graph into dependency-ordered waves, and phase 158 makes
a worker that keeps editing *after* reporting DONE visible instead of silent. All six
phases settled; all published packages bumped `1.41.0 → 1.42.0` in lockstep. **No new
DESIGN.md D-number** (additive to the existing boundary + dispatch models).

- **Phase 155 — boundary-enforcement `block` mode** ✓ (rec-20260704-001) — opt-in
  `boundaryEnforcement: 'block'`; the pre-tool edit check refuses the edit rather than
  warning. Default `warn` behavior byte-for-byte unchanged.
- **Phase 156 — settle-time boundary diff scan** ✓ — direct follow-on to 155: settle
  re-derives touched paths from the diff and compares them against the DRAFT's `files:`,
  so a violation that dodged the edit-time hook is still caught at the completion claim.
- **Phase 157 — multi-line Objective truncation fix** ✓ (rec-20260704-002) —
  `parseSpecMd` kept only the first line of a multi-line `## Objective`, silently
  discarding SPEC content downstream of the parse.
- **Phase 158 — subagent task-redundancy monitoring** ✓ — post-DONE file touches
  detected at edit time and at `SubagentStop`.
- **Phase 159 — wave-based subagent dispatch** ✓ — `cadence dispatch plan` emits
  dependency-ordered dispatch waves from the approved DRAFT.
- **Phase 160 — Release v1.42.0** ✓ — changeset consumed; lockstep `1.41.0 → 1.42.0`;
  CLAUDE.md narrative leads with `1.42.0`.

- **Scope guards (as built).** *In:* both boundary-enforcement halves, the SPEC parser
  fix, redundancy monitoring, dispatch waves, release. *Out:* `block` as the default
  (`warn` remains default); automatic wave *execution* — `dispatch plan` emits the plan,
  the operator/host runs it.

## v1.43.0 – v1.44.1 — Trustworthy verification, gate/settle audit-trail integrity, onboarding polish — ✓ SHIPPED 2026-07-10 → 07-12

*Backfilled 2026-07-27 from the settled artifacts under `.cadence/phases/161–177`. None of
these tags has a dedicated release phase, so the phase→version attribution below is
**date-derived** (settle date vs tag date) and is approximate at the boundaries.*

| tag | tagged | phases attributed (date-derived) |
|---|---|---|
| v1.43.0 | 2026-07-10 | 161–164 |
| v1.44.0 | 2026-07-11 | 165–169 |
| v1.44.1 | 2026-07-12 | 170, 171, 173, 174, 176, 177 |

Three threads run through this window. The first is closing the "mock-default undercuts the
enforcement wedge" competitive risk end to end: phase 164 makes verifier-key discovery reach
beyond `export`ed env vars (`.env` file, committed provider config) and turns `cadence activate`
into a real smoke-tested call instead of a key-string check; phase 165 adds a 4th verifier
provider (`host-cli`) that shells out to the user's already-authenticated `claude`/`codex`
binary so independent verification works with zero separately-configured API key; phases 166–167
generalize assertion-mode coverage from a JS/TS-only scanner into a shared lexer engine with
built-in python/go/rust/php profiles (167 is this arc's other complex-tier keystone, alongside
163); phase 169 closes a real documented gap — a test hidden behind `.skip`/`.todo`/`.failing`
no longer counts as qualifying coverage even with an intact assertion inside it. The second
thread is settle/gate audit-trail integrity: phase 170 makes a refusing gate persist a SUMMARY
instead of vanishing with only an ephemeral stderr line, phase 173 adds optimistic-concurrency
revision checking to the single state-write choke point so two racing writers can't silently
lose an update, and phase 176 closes the last gap in that story — a gate that *throws* (not just
one that refuses) now also produces an audited SUMMARY. The third thread is onboarding and
portfolio polish: phase 161 sweeps stale surface-model/Claude-Code-only doc claims and adds a
CTO-facing README section, phase 162 makes Codex a one-command bootstrap target, phase 163
(complex tier) hardens `cadence resume`/`handoff` with fetch-backed freshness checks and a
completion gate, phase 171 fixes a real destructive-install incident (malformed
`.claude/settings.json` silently wiped third-party hooks), and phase 174 adds a post-settle
retro digest with an optional `gh issue` offer. The test-gutting demo becomes the README's
flagship example across three phases: 168 lands it as a committed, deterministic example; 175
(no phase directory — see numbering ledger) repositions the README hero to lead with it; a stale
branch merge (PR #189) accidentally reverted that hero back to billsplit-only, and 177 restores
it with an animated `gutting.svg` terminal recording. All published packages advanced
`1.42.0 → 1.43.0 → 1.44.0 → 1.44.1` in lockstep across the three tags. **No new DESIGN.md
D-number** (D12 predates this window at Phase 70; nothing here crossed a locked-decision
boundary).

- **Phase 161 — Portfolio readiness doc sync** ✓ — normalized "one engine, three surface
  categories ... four current entry points" vocabulary across README/docs/DESIGN.md/CONTEXT.md,
  removed stale "Claude Code only"/exclusive-ambient-gates claims (Codex now described as a
  shipped host-adapter/conformance consumer), added a "For technical reviewers" section + Mermaid
  architecture diagram + portfolio summary to README, backed by a new doc-content assertion test.
- **Phase 162 — Codex first-run bootstrap** ✓ (rec-20260708-001) — added a Codex bootstrap entry
  point that shells out to the Codex host installer, generalized the managed agent block so
  `AGENTS.md` generates/regenerates alongside `CLAUDE.md`, added Codex readiness doctor
  checks/fixes, and documented the pre-Codex first-run ordering with a CLI fallback.
- **Phase 163 — Handoff/Resume hardening: freshness & completion gates** ✓ — fetch-backed git
  facts (`readGitFacts` fetches by default, `--no-fetch` opt-out), an origin-ahead banner
  (`checkRemoteFreshness`, `config.resume.remoteCheck`, `--offline`), unfilled
  `<!-- FILL IN -->` section detection on resume, a new `cadence handoff --check` completion
  gate (exit 0/1/3), and handoff's files-in-play capped to the same selected recs every other
  scope uses.
- **Phase 164 — Trustworthy verifier activation** ✓ — broader key discovery
  (`discoverKey`: env var, then a repo-root `.env` file, no new runtime dependency), a
  non-skippable activation smoke test gating `cadence activate`'s reported success on one real
  provider call, and committed-provider-config inheritance so a teammate with the same kind of
  key inherits real verification without running `activate` themselves; an as-built T5 amendment
  threaded `cwd`/`repoRoot` into 6 real production verifier-selection call sites (doctor, settle
  ×3, build/draft gates, spec-approve) after independent review found the unit-tested primitives
  alone didn't reach `cadence mcp serve --repo <path>`.
- **Phase 165 — Host-CLI headless verifier provider** ✓ (rec-20260710-002) — a 4th verifier
  provider (`host-cli`) spawning the user's already-authenticated `claude`/`codex` binary in
  headless mode; the JSON-extraction/schema-repair-retry harness was factored out of
  `local-client.ts` into a shared transport-agnostic module reused by both providers; loud,
  non-blocking mock fallback when the binary is missing/unauthenticated. As-built: only
  `per-task-verify` got a real `hostCli` builder wired end-to-end — `deep-verify` and the other
  4 review families still fall back to mock, narrowing AC-1's original scope. Per-gate-run
  batching (rec-20260710-004) and the MCP-driven inversion alternative (rec-20260710-003) were
  explicitly deferred.
- **Phase 166 — Language-aware coverage defaults** ✓ — `cadence init` now defaults
  `verification.coverageMode: 'assertion'` only for detected js/ts projects; every other/unknown
  language defaults to `mention` with language-aware default test-file globs (python/go/rust/php);
  the test-coverage gate's refusal message now distinguishes a glob-discovery miss from an
  assertion-parsing miss, and `cadence doctor` flags assertion mode paired with a non-js/ts
  detected language.
- **Phase 167 — Shared-lexer multi-language assertion-coverage engine** ✓ — generalized
  `findTestSpans` into one shared string/comment-aware engine parameterized by a per-language
  profile (opener/assertion patterns, comment/string tables, one of four block-boundary
  strategies), re-expressing js/ts with byte-identical behavior and shipping built-in
  python/go/rust/php profiles, per-file dispatch with a strict zero-spans-on-unrecognized-shape
  invariant, an add-only `verification.coverageProfiles` config escape hatch with load-time
  validation, a `cadence verify coverage --explain` diagnostic, and a doc-tested supported-
  language matrix. Zero new runtime dependency — homegrown lexer, no tree-sitter (dec-20260711-001,
  LOCKED).
- **Phase 168 — Land test-gutting demo as a committed example** ✓ — extracted
  `docs/demo-test-gutting.zip` into `examples/demo-test-gutting/`, verified `run-demo.sh`
  end-to-end against a locally built v1.43.0 CLI, reconciled `docs/DEMO.md`'s transcripts against
  real v1.43 output (Beat 3's refusal message had drifted under phase 166's diagnostics),
  confirmed determinism across two independent runs.
- **Phase 169 — Assertion-mode coverage refuses the .skip/.todo/.failing dodge** ✓ — an AC
  linked only to a `test.skip`/`.todo`/`.failing` block with an intact assertion call no longer
  counts as qualifying; `findTestSpans` flags skip/todo/failing openers as non-asserting
  regardless of assertion-token presence, and a new distinct refusal message ("only linked test
  is skipped") separates this case from "no linked test" and "mentioned but not asserting."
- **Phase 170 — Refused settle persists gate provenance + SUMMARY** ✓ — added a `refused`
  `GateProvenance` status + `reason` field (additive, back-compat with pre-existing ran/skipped
  records), threaded the refusal reason verbatim through all 9 settle-dispatched gate impls, and
  a refused settle now persists `SUMMARY.json`/`.md` with the gates array populated through the
  refusing entry and zero `loopPosition`/`activeDraft` mutation.
- **Phase 171 — Installer destructive-recovery: preserve third-party settings on parse failure**
  ✓ — fixes the real deja-hooks-wiped incident (31f1351 / PR #170): `installHooks()` now
  distinguishes `ENOENT` (still starts fresh) from malformed JSON (now refuses the install
  instead of resetting to `{}`), and every successful write goes through a timestamped backup +
  atomic temp-file rename.
- **Phase 173 — Optimistic concurrency for cadence state writes** ✓ — added a `revision` field
  to `CadenceState` (default 0, backward-compatible) and an optimistic-concurrency check in
  `SimpleStateBackend.commit()` — the single write choke point every writer (CLI, hooks, MCP)
  shares — refusing a stale commit with a new `StateConflictError` naming both revisions, while a
  single command's own sequential commits on one in-memory object never self-conflict. Lock
  files/PID tracking were explicitly rejected during spec review in favor of pure in-process
  comparison.
- **Phase 174 — Post-settle retro artifact + GitHub issue offer** ✓ (rec-20260712-001) — every
  successful settle now synthesizes a friction digest (gate bypasses, non-DONE tasks,
  code-review/security-audit/boundary-scan findings) from data already in SUMMARY, writes it as
  `<draftId>-RETRO.json`/`.md`, and — only for a friction-having digest on an interactive run —
  offers to file a GitHub issue via `gh`; fully config-toggleable and non-fatal on any failure.
  Cross-phase retro rollup and Praxis-scoring feedback (rec-20260712-002/003) explicitly deferred.
- **Phase 175 — README leads with the test-gutting demo** ✓ (no phase directory — see numbering
  ledger) — repositioned README's hero section to lead with the test-gutting demo (docs/DEMO.md's
  "Your CI is green. Cadence still said no." framing) ahead of the existing $100/3 billsplit
  demo, which was kept as a secondary example rather than deleted.

*(Phase 172 was never used — see the numbering ledger.)*

- **Phase 176 — Audit trail for settle gate throws** ✓ (rec-20260712-007) — `runSettleGates` now
  catches any exception thrown by a gate impl (previously only `security-audit` self-normalized
  its own throws) and converts it into a `refuse` `GateResult`, routing it through phase 170's
  refusal path so a raw throw also produces an audited SUMMARY instead of escaping uncaught to
  `settle.ts`'s outer catch with no record at all.
- **Phase 177 — README embeds the animated test-gutting demo SVG** ✓ — restored README's
  test-gutting-demo hero (accidentally reverted to the old billsplit-only version when PR #189
  merged a stale branch over phase 175's PR #188), this time replacing the static Beat-3
  transcript with a looping `gutting.svg` terminal recording of all 4 DEMO.md beats, and
  committed the new recording assets (`gutting.svg`, `gutting.cast`, `record-demo.sh`).

- **Scope guards (as built).** *In:* doc/portfolio polish, Codex onboarding, handoff/resume
  freshness + completion gates, verifier-trustworthiness (broader key discovery + activation
  smoke test + committed provider config), the host-cli verifier provider, language-aware
  coverage defaults plus the full multi-language coverage engine (python/go/rust/php), closing
  the `.skip` dodge, refused-settle and gate-throw SUMMARY persistence, installer parse-failure
  recovery, optimistic-concurrency state writes, the post-settle retro artifact, and the
  test-gutting demo becoming the README's flagship example. *Out:* OS keychain key discovery and
  `local`-provider activation smoke-testing (phase 164); per-gate-run batching, quota-transparency
  messaging, and the MCP-driven inversion alternative for the host-cli provider (phase 165); new
  per-language assertion-span parsing beyond the four shipped profiles (phase 166); a
  `--collect-all` "keep running all gates after a refusal" diagnostic mode (phase 170); an
  explicit opt-in `install --repair` auto-fix path (phase 171); cross-phase retro rollup and
  Praxis-scoring feedback from retro friction (phase 174).

## v1.45.0 – v1.46.0 — Verifier/security hardening + onboarding ergonomics — ✓ SHIPPED 2026-07-15 → 07-17

*Backfilled 2026-07-27 from the settled artifacts under `.cadence/phases/178–191`. None of
these tags has a dedicated release phase, so the phase→version attribution below is
**date-derived** (settle date vs tag date) and is approximate at the boundaries.*

| tag | tagged | phases attributed (date-derived) |
|---|---|---|
| v1.45.0 | 2026-07-15 | 178–185 |
| v1.46.0 | 2026-07-17 | 186–191 |

This arc's first half hardens the parts of CADENCE that talk to external processes or persist
sensitive data: the headless host-CLI verifier gets a quota-transparency notice, a
self-invocation guard, and a spawn timeout (178); a shared `redactSecrets` utility closes two
verbatim-secret leak vectors — `Evidence.summary` and `security-audit` `Finding.message`
(including a second stderr-logging leak the T3 implementer caught mid-task) — and restricts
intelligence-ledger JSON files to `0o600` (180); MCP's two approval-bypass tools
(`cadence_draft_approve`/`cadence_spec_approve`) gain a caller-issued trust envelope bound to
origin, a structural tool-def hash, a capability class, and expiry, closing the "the tool call
IS the approval" gap with no revoke/expiry logic (181, complex tier); a `security-audit`-scoped
`AbortSignal`/`traceId` threads through `host-cli-client.ts`, the `Verifier` interface, and
`SecurityAuditVerifier`, wired end-to-end for one real gate to prove it's connected, not orphaned
(184); and CI gains CodeQL, gitleaks secret scanning, an npm-audit-exceptions policy, and
SBOM/license-inventory generation, all on push/PR/weekly cron (182). Alongside the security
theme, 179 adds `cadence milestone status` (read-only worktree fan-in reconciliation), 183
extends the generated-docs drift-check discipline to per-command flags/config schema
keys/exit-code taxonomy, and 185 makes the pre-release tarball smoke test exercise the real
DRAFT→BUILD→SETTLE loop instead of just `--help`. All eight phases settled; published packages
bumped to `1.45.0` in lockstep. The second half is a smaller, ops/DX-focused batch: a read-only
`cadence retro` cross-phase friction rollup (186); a fix so `--allow-auto-complex` soft-cap
overrides actually land in `SUMMARY.json`'s `gateBypasses` instead of being stderr-only (187); a
new `init --full` mega-flag and a `cadence onboard` command for the 2nd-Nth teammate cloning an
already-`.cadence/`-initialized repo (188, 189); `doctor --fix` auto-remediation for the
handoff-retention check, reusing the existing pruning primitives (190); and host-cli builders
wired for the 5 verifier families phase 165 left unwired — spec-review, plan-review, code-review,
security-audit, and deep-verify — closing a real-world gap where a downstream project's
`host-cli`-configured spec-review gate was silently rubber-stamping via mock fallback (191).
Published packages bumped to `1.46.0` in lockstep. **No new DESIGN.md D-number** resulted from
either version.

- **Phase 178 — headless-verifier guardrails** ✓ (rec-20260710-006) — `host-cli-client.ts` gets a
  once-per-process quota-transparency stderr notice, a self-invocation refusal (detects running
  inside the same host-CLI family via its session env var, falls back to mock through the
  existing `wrapWithFallback` path), and a configurable spawn timeout (`HostCliError({reason:
  'timeout'})`). As-built: the self-invocation env-var check also fires for ordinary Claude-Code
  subagent sessions (this repo's own standard workflow), so two more pre-existing test suites
  needed `env: {}` pinning to stay deterministic.
- **Phase 179 — `cadence milestone status`** ✓ — read-only fan-in command mapping a milestone's
  converted recommendations to their owning worktree (local/sibling, via phase 142's
  `gatherHandoffCandidates`) and that worktree's live loop position; unconverted recs and
  unmatched phases are reported as `not-yet-converted`/`no-worktree-found`, never dropped.
  Fan-out (automated worktree provisioning) stays explicitly out of scope.
- **Phase 180 — secret redaction for evidence + security-audit findings** ✓ — new
  `redactSecrets()` utility (AWS keys, GitHub tokens, bearer/basic auth headers, JWTs, PEM
  blocks, generic `key=`/`token=`/`password=`/`secret=` assignments) applied at
  `addRecommendation`'s evidence-summary write and the `security-audit` gate's `Finding.message`
  write; intelligence ledger JSON files now write `0o600` on POSIX. As-built: also closed a
  second leak the T3 implementer found — the gate's stderr critical-finding log was printing the
  raw unredacted message even after the SUMMARY write was fixed.
- **Phase 181 — MCP tool-trust envelope** ✓ — the 18 registered MCP tools get a `capabilityClass`
  (`READ_ONLY`/`LEDGER_WRITE`/`LOOP_WRITE`/`APPROVAL_BYPASS`/`SETTLE`); a structural
  `computeToolDefHash` fingerprints name+description+inputSchema; a file-backed
  `.cadence/mcp-trust.json` grant ledger plus `cadence mcp trust grant/revoke/list` CLI; the two
  `APPROVAL_BYPASS` tools now refuse without a valid, unexpired, def-hash-matching,
  version-matching grant, naming the failing check. `cadence_settle` (`SETTLE` class) is
  classified but deliberately left ungated this phase.
- **Phase 182 — CI security automation** ✓ (rec-20260712-013) — new `codeql.yml`
  (javascript-typescript, push/PR/weekly cron) and consolidated `security.yml` (gitleaks secret
  scan, npm-audit-exceptions policy against `docs/security/audit-exceptions.md`, CycloneDX
  SBOM + license inventory, all on push/PR/weekly cron). As-built: `pnpm audit` under the
  repo's pinned pnpm hits npm's retired legacy audit endpoint, so the audit cross-check needed a
  dedicated `scripts/check-audit-exceptions.mjs` running a pinned modern pnpm via corepack.
- **Phase 183 — generated-docs drift check** ✓ (rec-20260712-012) — extends the existing
  drift-guard discipline to per-command registered flags (`commands.md`), the config schema's
  top-level key set (`config.md`), and a new `docs/reference/exit-codes.md` cross-checked against
  every exit-code literal actually used in `packages/core/src`; all as vitest assertions under
  the existing `ci-success` test job, no new workflow needed.
- **Phase 184 — verifier AbortSignal/traceId plumbing** ✓ (rec-20260712-010) — optional
  `signal`/`traceId` threaded through `host-cli-client.ts` (new `HostCliError` reason
  `'aborted'`), the `Verifier` interface (`LocalVerifier` forwards to `fetch`, `MockVerifier`
  ignores), and `SecurityAuditVerifier`; the `security-audit` gate generates a per-run
  `crypto.randomUUID()` traceId and passes it through on its one real call site, proving the
  plumbing is genuinely connected for at least one gate. `PerTaskVerifier`/`CodeReviewVerifier`/
  `PlanReviewVerifier`/`SpecReviewVerifier` explicitly deferred to a future phase.
- **Phase 185 — smoke-test the packed npm tarball** ✓ — `scripts/publish-proof.mjs`'s
  post-install check now runs `cadence init` → `draft new` → `draft approve` → `build task
  --status=DONE` → `settle run --auto` (5 steps — the approve step wasn't anticipated when AC-1
  was drafted) against the verdaccio-installed CLI inside the clean temp project, not just
  `--help`; teardown stays unconditional on a mid-loop failure. Not wired into CI in this phase.
- **Phase 186 — cross-phase retro rollup** ✓ (rec-20260712-002) — read-only `cadence retro` scans
  every settled phase's `*-RETRO.json`, computing gate-bypass/rough-task-status/finding-category
  frequency counts with recurring-vs-one-off buckets so a 2+-phase pattern isn't buried under
  one-off noise; empty/missing/malformed-artifact cases handled per the repo's best-effort
  introspection convention. Feeding retro friction into Praxis scoring (rec-20260712-003) stays
  explicitly out of scope.
- **Phase 187 — `gateBypasses` records `--allow-auto-complex` overrides** ✓ — fixes
  `settle.ts`'s and `draft-approve.ts`'s soft-cap override checks being stderr-only and invisible
  to `SUMMARY.json`'s `gateBypasses`, contradicting CLAUDE.md's "every bypass is loud and
  recorded" claim; new `auto-complex-override` `AnomalyType` wired through settle's
  `gateBypassesFromAnomalies` and draft-approve's `anomaly-notify` notifier pathway.
- **Phase 188 — `cadence init --full`** ✓ — collapses `--wire-host`/`--demo`/`--activate` into
  one flag (`opts.wireHost ?? opts.full` per flag — an explicit flag still overrides `--full`'s
  default), degrades safely when preconditions (host workspace, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) are absent,
  and prints a consolidated "what I did/skipped" summary alongside (not replacing) the existing
  per-feature messages. Bare `cadence init` behavior is byte-for-byte unchanged.
- **Phase 189 — `cadence onboard`** ✓ — one-command per-machine setup for a teammate cloning a
  repo with `.cadence/` already committed: installs host hooks via a newly-extracted shared
  `host-wire.ts` module (also used by `init --full`), reports project name/gate profile/
  provider-readiness without touching `config.json`/`state.json`, and refuses cleanly with no
  `.cadence/` present; `cadence init` now seeds a merge-idempotent `CONTRIBUTING.md` block
  pointing the next contributor at it.
- **Phase 190 — `doctor --fix` auto-remediates handoff retention** ✓ — a deliberately narrowed
  slice of rec-20260709-002: when `handoff.retain` is unset and the SESSION-doc archive exceeds
  the existing warn threshold, `--fix` now sets the default and prunes to budget via the
  existing `pruneHandoffDir`/`selectPrunable` primitives (never reimplemented), always retaining
  the current `lastHandoff` file. The other four manual-only checks (`worktree-phases`,
  `verification-readiness`, `recommendation-shipped-drift`, `coverage-mode-language-support`)
  stay manual — each needs a genuine judgment call doctor can't safely automate.
- **Phase 191 — host-cli builders for the last 5 verifier families** ✓ — wires a real
  `HostCli*Verifier` for spec-review, plan-review, code-review, security-audit, and deep-verify
  (`Verifier`), each mirroring the existing `HostCliPerTaskVerifier` pattern against its family's
  own prompt/schema; security-audit and deep-verify additionally thread `{signal, traceId}`
  through to `hostCliJSON`. Closes a real gap surfaced by a downstream project ("necro") whose
  `host-cli`-configured spec-review gate was silently mock-falling-back and rubber-stamping.

- **Scope guards (as built).** *In:* headless-verifier guardrails, milestone worktree
  reconciliation, secret redaction + ledger file permissions, the MCP trust envelope (minus
  `cadence_settle`), CI security automation, docs-drift checks, abort-signal plumbing for
  `security-audit`, a real-loop tarball smoke test, the retro rollup, the `gateBypasses` fix,
  `init --full` + `cadence onboard`, doctor's handoff-retention auto-fix, and host-cli builders
  for the remaining 5 verifier families. *Out:* MCP request batching (178); gating
  `cadence_settle` under the trust envelope (181); retro-friction-feeds-Praxis-scoring
  (rec-20260712-003, 186); abort-signal plumbing for `PerTaskVerifier`/`CodeReviewVerifier`/
  `PlanReviewVerifier`/`SpecReviewVerifier` (184); wiring `publish-proof.mjs` into CI (185); the
  other four manual-only doctor checks (190); adding `{signal, traceId}` to the four verifier
  interfaces phase 184 didn't touch (191).

## v1.47.0 – v1.48.0 — Dispatch-safety hardening, worktree-safe state tracking, and intelligence-ledger fixes — ✓ SHIPPED 2026-07-18 → 07-19

*Backfilled 2026-07-27 from the settled artifacts under `.cadence/phases/192–200`. Phase→version
boundaries are **evidenced**, not date-derived — the two release commits (`1923f6bb` for
v1.47.0, `0bec56bb` for v1.48.0) each enumerate their exact bundled phase list in the commit
body. That evidence puts the split at 194/195, not 195/196 as a pure settle-date-vs-tag-date
comparison would suggest (phase 195 settled 2026-07-18T22:50Z, before the v1.47.0 tag's commit
time of 16:12Z-05:00 on the same calendar day but after the tag's UTC cut — the release commit
is the disambiguating source of truth here). v1.48.0's release also bundled phase 201, one phase
past this arc's boundary; it is out of scope for this fragment.

| tag | tagged | phases attributed (evidenced via release-commit body) |
|---|---|---|
| v1.47.0 | 2026-07-18 | 192–194 |
| v1.48.0 | 2026-07-19 | 195–200 (of the release's 195–201; 201 is outside this arc) |

The arc opens with a real incident: on 2026-07-18, a dispatched fork agent in the deja repo
self-recorded its own `cadence build`/`settle` outcome and committed directly to `main` four
times, unsupervised, before any orchestrator review (rec-20260718-001). Phases 192–193 are the
direct fix — a mandatory prohibition block in every rendered dispatch packet forbidding an agent
from self-recording status, plus a `recommendIsolation` heuristic (rec-20260718-002) that
surfaces `'worktree'|'none'` per task in `dispatch plan`'s output so isolation stops being pure
human/skill convention. Phase 194 closes a live StateConflictError bug (issue #234): telemetry-only
counters (`session.subagentSpawns`) were going through the same revision-guarded
`SimpleStateBackend.commit()` as structural writes, so a long-running verifier gate could get
invalidated by an unrelated `SubagentStop` telemetry bump; `bumpSessionCounter` gives telemetry a
write path exempt from the optimistic-concurrency compare-and-swap while structural state keeps
its existing guard unchanged. Phase 195 adds the `task-verify-required` settle gate (issue #206,
rec-20260712-001) — settle no longer writes a bare `T1: DONE` into SUMMARY.md when a task's
`- verify:` line was empty; gate count goes 13→14. Phase 196 is the arc's keystone: it fixes
issue #177 (cross-worktree `.cadence/state.json`/`STATE.md` merge conflicts) by gitignoring the
four CADENCE-owned ephemeral paths by default, adding a `doctor --fix` migration, preserving the
audit-trail value of a tracked `state.json` via a new `stateAtSettle` SUMMARY snapshot, adding
conflict-marker diagnosis + a `--resolve-state-conflict` repair flag, and self-migrating this
repo's own tracked state. Phase 197 is 196's necessary fallout: making `state.json` per-worktree
silently broke `cadence onboard`'s bootstrap path for a fresh worktree or clone, dead-ending every
state-reading command in `NotInitializedError`; `onboard` now bootstraps a fresh IDLE
`state.json`, deriving the project name from `PROJECT.md`'s header rather than `package.json`
(which disagrees with it in this very repo). Phase 198 closes a CodeQL ReDoS finding (issue #249)
by length-capping `--filter-regex` before compilation in `assumption`/`decision`/`recommendation`.
Phases 199–200 round out the intelligence-ledger CLI: `recommendation evidence add` (issue-free,
a genuine gap — the only prior path to attach evidence to an existing recommendation was a manual
lockstep hand-edit of two files), and a fix for `nextRecommendationId` colliding with archived IDs
once every same-day recommendation had been archived (issue #248). All nine phases settled;
v1.47.0 and v1.48.0 both landed as `@manehorizons/cadence-core` minor bumps with the other three
published packages patch-cascaded to match (a known, manual, recurring lockstep step per the
v1.48.0 release commit — changesets' `fixed`/`linked` config is intentionally left empty). **No
new DESIGN.md D-number** (D12 remains the latest entry; this arc's work is additive to the
existing state-backend, gate-matrix, and dispatch-packet models).

- **Phase 192 — dispatch-packet action-class prohibition boilerplate** ✓ (rec-20260718-001) —
  mandatory prohibition block added to `renderPacket`'s output forbidding a dispatched agent
  from self-recording its own `cadence build task --status=...` outcome; instructs it to stop
  and report to the orchestrator instead. `docs/reference/commands.md`'s dispatch-plan Behavior
  paragraph updated to match.
- **Phase 193 — dispatch-plan worktree-isolation recommendation** ✓ (rec-20260718-002) — pure
  `recommendIsolation(task)` heuristic (`'worktree'` when a task declares `files:`, `'none'`
  otherwise) threaded into `renderPacket`'s text and into `dispatch plan --json`'s
  `DispatchTaskPlan.recommendedIsolation` field.
- **Phase 194 — telemetry-only session counters exempted from the revision guard** ✓ — new
  `StateBackend.bumpSessionCounter` write path for `session.subagentSpawns` that bypasses
  optimistic-concurrency compare-and-swap, fixing a deterministic `StateConflictError` (issue
  #234) when a host-cli verifier gate overlapped a concurrent telemetry-only commit; structural
  state's revision guard is unchanged (confirmed by a new structural-conflict regression test).
- **Phase 195 — `task-verify-required` settle gate** ✓ (rec-20260712-001) — settle now refuses
  to finalize a task as DONE when its DRAFT `- verify:` field is empty, closing issue #206;
  registered in `standard`+`complex` tiers across all profiles; gate matrix count 13→14.
- **Phase 196 — worktree-safe state tracking** ✓ — `state.json`, `STATE.md`, `mcp-trust.json`,
  and `intelligence/context/` gitignored by default (issue #177) with a `doctor --fix` migration;
  new `stateAtSettle` SUMMARY snapshot preserves the audit-trail value a tracked `state.json` used
  to carry incidentally; conflict-marker diagnosis plus a `--resolve-state-conflict` repair flag
  added; every non-conflict-repairing catch site funnels through a shared `formatCommandError`
  pointer to the fix; this repo's own tracked `.cadence/` state self-migrated in the same phase.
- **Phase 197 — `cadence onboard` bootstraps missing `state.json`** ✓ — closes the dead-end 196
  left for a fresh worktree or a fresh clone of a repo with `.cadence/` already committed;
  `onboard` now creates a fresh IDLE `state.json`, deriving the project name from `PROJECT.md`'s
  header (not `package.json`, which disagrees with it here); `doctor`'s missing-state-json
  remediation text corrected to point at the real fix.
- **Phase 198 — `--filter-regex` length bound (ReDoS guard)** ✓ — closes issue #249 (CodeQL):
  `assumption.ts`/`decision.ts`/`recommendation.ts` now reject oversized `--filter-regex`
  patterns before compiling them with `new RegExp(...)`; guard duplicated per-file matching the
  existing `parseRegexFlags` precedent, no new shared helper or runtime dependency.
- **Phase 199 — `cadence recommendation evidence add` CLI writer** ✓ — new
  `addEvidenceToRecommendation` store function atomically appends an evidence entry and links its
  id into the target recommendation's `evidenceIds`, closing the only remaining path that
  required a manual, easy-to-desync hand-edit of `evidence.json`/`recommendations.json` together.
- **Phase 200 — recommendation-ID collision fix (archived IDs)** ✓ — `nextRecommendationId` now
  scans `ledger.archived` as well as `ledger.recommendations` when computing the next same-day
  sequence number, closing issue #248 (a day where every recommendation had been archived reset
  the counter to `001` and collided with the first ID issued that day); the other three ledger
  types' next-ID functions are unaffected by design.

- **Scope guards (as built).** *In:* dispatch-packet self-record prohibition, the isolation
  recommendation heuristic, the telemetry revision-guard exemption, the verify-evidence settle
  gate, worktree-safe state tracking end-to-end (gitignore + migration + `stateAtSettle` +
  conflict repair), the onboard bootstrap fallout fix, the ReDoS length guard, and both
  intelligence-ledger CLI/store fixes. *Out (phase 192):* worktree-default isolation itself and
  an `isolation` schema field — explicitly deferred to rec-20260718-002 (phase 193). *Out (phase
  198):* a catastrophic-backtracking heuristic or a shared validator module — a fixed length cap
  duplicated per-file was the chosen scope.

## v1.49.0 – v1.50.0 — Praxis lifecycle UX + consumer-repo CI verification — ✓ SHIPPED 2026-07-20 → 07-22

*Backfilled 2026-07-27 from the settled artifacts under `.cadence/phases/201–211`. Neither tag has a dedicated release phase, so the phase→version attribution below is **date-derived** (settle date vs tag date) and is approximate at the boundaries.*

| tag | tagged | phases attributed (date-derived) |
|---|---|---|
| v1.49.0 | 2026-07-20 | 201–203 |
| v1.50.0 | 2026-07-22 | 204–211 |

v1.49.0 closed out three long-standing gaps in the Praxis intelligence layer's own lifecycle tooling: a milestone pre-mortem had no CLI path for an operator to add judgment calls the deterministic heuristics can't derive (201), a deferred milestone had no way back to `proposed` short of hand-editing `milestones.json` (203), and reviewers had no deterministic way to see gate/settle results without opening raw `SUMMARY.json` (202, the first half of the "team rollout kit" rec — the CI-gate-generator half was explicitly deferred to a later phase). v1.50.0 is the larger of the two: its keystone is 204's `cadence verify phase` + `cadence init --ci` — phase-scoped, state-independent re-derivation of whether a settled phase's AC coverage still holds, plus a GitHub Actions scaffold that calls it — which is exactly the CI-gate half 202 deferred. Alongside it: an opt-in UI-SPEC gate between SPEC and DRAFT for UI-heavy phases (205), a `cadence next` command that surfaces `nextAction()`'s ranked legal moves at any loop position with a versioned `--json` contract (206), a sweep making every intelligence-layer empty-result/refusal message name its precondition, nearest candidates, and unblocking command (207, which also picks up the empty-state-footer integration 206 explicitly deferred), a `cadence doctor` check plus CLAUDE.md/skill guidance against concurrent-session collisions on the same phase/draft (208 — this is the origin of the "Zombie Session" named failure mode), and a three-phase split closing out the "Claude Code login ≠ `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`" confusion across the runtime warning (209), the docs (210), and `doctor`/`activate`'s CLAUDECODE-aware messaging (211). **No new DESIGN.md D-number** in either tag — all eleven phases are additive to the existing gate/CLI/doc surfaces (the UI-SPEC gate is documented as a §4 gate-matrix delta, not a new locked decision).

- **Phase 201 — milestone pre-mortem CLI writer for operator-authored fields** ✓ (rec-20260714-001) — `--add-out-of-scope`/`--add-likely-failure-mode`/`--add-hidden-dependency` repeatable flags on `cadence milestone premortem <id>`; operator-added `likelyFailureModes`/`hiddenDependencies` entries now survive a later deterministic refresh the same way `outOfScope` already did, via a marker-and-filter convention in `deepenPreMortem`.
- **Phase 202 — team rollout kit** ✓ — `cadence summary render <phase> <num>` prints a deterministic human-readable rendering of a settled phase's gate/AC outcomes for pasting into PR review, refusing loudly on missing/malformed `SUMMARY.json`; paired with `docs/team-rollout.md` covering shared team conventions without replacing existing CI or human review.
- **Phase 203 — milestone reopen: deferred → proposed transition** ✓ — `cadence milestone reopen <id>` adds the missing `applyTransition()` path out of `deferred`, guarded against `recommendationId` collision with any live survivor milestone, so a stuck milestone's claimed recs re-enter `clusterMilestones()`'s re-clustering pool instead of staying permanently excluded.
- **Phase 204 — `cadence init --ci`: CI-gate re-verification for consumer repos** ✓ (rec-20260709-003) — `cadence verify phase` phase-scopes coverage re-derivation to a settled phase's own DRAFT task files against the current working tree (no active loop state required, no cross-phase AC-token collision), with `--changed --base` discovery and a test-command re-run reported as a line distinct from coverage drift; `cadence init --ci` scaffolds `.github/workflows/cadence-verify.yml` with a real install+test command and prints (never executes) the `gh api` branch-protection recipe.
- **Phase 205 — UI-SPEC gate (`spec new --ui` / `ui-spec-review`)** ✓ (rec-20260711-004) — an opt-in `<id>-UI-SPEC.md` sibling to SPEC with per-component Layout/Tokens/Precedent-Reference sections, gated by a convergent `ui-spec-review` reusing the `nextConvergence` primitive; an APPROVED UI-SPEC seeds a `## UI Contract` section into the scaffolded DRAFT.
- **Phase 206 — `cadence next`: state-derived legal next moves** ✓ (rec-20260721-002) — extends the engine's existing `nextAction()` (used by `quickstart`/`progress`) with ranked `legalMoves[]` rather than reimplementing it; `cadence next --json` exposes a versioned `schemaVersion: 1` contract; 15th slash command registered.
- **Phase 207 — empty states and refusals name the precondition, nearest candidates, and unblocking command** ✓ (rec-20260721-001) — extracts `next.ts`'s ranked-candidate logic into a shared `intelligence/nearest-candidate.ts` and threads it through `milestone propose`, `recommend`, recommendation not-found/refusal messages, and the retro rollup's zero-phases case; documents the four-part invariant in `docs/concepts.md` as the bar for future intelligence-layer commands.
- **Phase 208 — concurrent-session collision safety** ✓ (rec-20260722-001) — a `phase-freshness` `cadence doctor` check warns when the active phase's `PROGRESS.json` shows task activity within a 10-minute threshold (possible live concurrent session); the remaining behavioral guidance (confirm-dead-before-resume, resume-in-place, worktree isolation from task 1, immediate pre-op `git status`) is folded into `CLAUDE.md` and the `phase-build`/`pr-land` skills.
- **Phase 209 — Claude-Code-vs-`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` distinction in the mock-fallback warning** ✓ (rec-20260723-001) — the `anthropic`-provider mock-fallback warning (`verifier-factory.ts`) and `cadence config explain`'s `provider-no-key` warning both now state that a Claude Code login doesn't satisfy the provider's separately-billed API key, while preserving the exact `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is unset` substring five sibling tests depend on.
- **Phase 210 — docs callout: anthropic provider auth is separate from Claude Code's own login** ✓ (rec-20260723-002) — a callout in `docs/providers.md`'s `anthropic` section, modeled on the existing `host-cli` quota-transparency notice, stating the same login/key distinction before the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` setup snippet.
- **Phase 211 — CLAUDECODE-aware messaging for anthropic provider + host-cli suggestion** ✓ (rec-20260723-003) — when `deep-verify`'s provider is `anthropic`, the key is missing, and `CLAUDECODE=1`, `cadence doctor`'s verification-readiness check and `cadence activate`'s key-missing message (`renderText`/`renderJson`, with a `claudeCodeHostCliSuggested` JSON field) proactively suggest `cadence activate --provider host-cli`, via a shared `isClaudeCodeSession(env)` helper — byte-identical to today outside that specific case.

- **Scope guards (as built).** *In:* the full set above. *Out:* 202 explicitly deferred `cadence init --ci`/CI-gate-workflow scaffolding (picked up whole by 204); 206 explicitly deferred wiring its ranked-moves output into an empty-state footer (picked up by 207, which only exposes the computation for a later phase to consume, not the footer itself); 208 deliberately left the freshness threshold hardcoded (no config knob) and did not wire the check into `cadence resume` (stays read-only/doc-scoped per D10).


## v1.51.0 – v1.51.1 — Evidence-floor + trust-envelope gates, Praxis ledger unification — ✓ SHIPPED 2026-07-24 → 07-25

*Backfilled 2026-07-27 from the settled artifacts under `.cadence/phases/212–221`; those artifacts are the record and were not modified. Phase→version boundaries **evidenced** via the release commits (`d7dedf12` tags v1.51.0 at phase-218's predecessor state, `f835470d` tags v1.51.1) cross-checked against `CHANGELOG.md`'s own `[1.51.0]`/`[1.51.1]` sections, which name every phase in this arc explicitly.*

| tag | tagged | phases attributed (date-derived) |
|---|---|---|
| v1.51.0 | 2026-07-24 | 212–218 |
| v1.51.1 | 2026-07-25 | 219–221 |

This arc closes enforcement gaps at both ends of the loop CADENCE itself runs on. v1.51.0 tightens what "settled" is allowed to mean: `gates.evidenceFloor` (214) refuses a settle when an AC's PASS rests on evidence below a configured floor on the `ai-verified`>`executed`>`assertion`>`mention`>`unverified` ladder — closing the enforcement gap the Phase 140 ladder left as visibility-only — while phase 216 closes the matching MCP-surface gap by wrapping `cadence_settle` in the same `gatedRun` trust envelope already proven on the two `APPROVAL_BYPASS` tools. Around that keystone pair, 212 makes retro friction (phase 174/186's artifacts) feed back into Praxis scoring as a transparent `frictionPts` term, 213 turns on real per-package coverage thresholds in CI, 217 gates `CHANGELOG.md` currency the same way `CLAUDE.md`'s version line is already gated (closing the record-integrity gap that let the changelog silently stall at `1.6.0` for 44 versions), and 215 hardens the audit protocol itself — a new "The Unlogged Audit Finding" entry in `CLAUDE.md`, `dec-20260724-001`'s response to the v1.47.0 audit's P0 that never reached the ledger. v1.51.1 turns the release process's own rough edges and the Praxis ledgers' duplication into fixes: 218 gives post-publish npm verification a patient 10-attempt budget after the v1.51.0 Release workflow itself hit a CDN-propagation false-red, 219 closes an id-minting collision hole in `nextRecommendationId`, and 220 — the arc's largest phase — replaces all five subject ledgers' hand-rolled read/write/id-mint logic with one shared module, generalizing 219's safeguard to all four minting subjects and bringing milestones to parity in `audit`/`reconcile`/`stats`. 221 closes out three confirmed CLI/MCP parity gaps, including relocating `next`/`verify`/`explain` into `services/` so MCP can reach them. All published packages bumped `1.50.0 → 1.51.0 → 1.51.1` in lockstep across both tags. **No new DESIGN.md D-number** in this arc (both gates and the ledger unification are additive to existing models).

- **Phase 212 — Retro friction feeds back into Praxis scoring** ✓ (rec-20260712-003) — `cadence retro feedback` matches recurring cross-phase friction (bypass gates, rough task statuses, finding categories from `computeRetroRollup`'s recurring bucket) against recommendations by `affectedAreas`/`affectedFiles` overlap, writes idempotent `evidence.json` entries, and `scoreRecommendation` gains a new, capped, transparent `frictionPts` term.
- **Phase 213 — Coverage thresholds enforced in CI** ✓ (rec-20260712-014) — `vitest.shared.ts` gained real per-package `coverage.thresholds` (provider `v8`, `include: src/**`) derived from measured coverage with headroom; the dead root-only `vitest.config.ts` coverage block was removed; the gate was proven to actually fail on an injected regression before being confirmed clean.
- **Phase 214 — `gates.evidenceFloor`** ✓ (rec-20260724-001) — new settle gate refuses when any AC's PASS evidence ranks below a configured floor; preset defaults `solo`→`assertion`, `team`/`production`→`executed`; an `ai-verified`-under-mock-provider refusal names the structural reason instead of a generic message; a required-reason per-AC bypass records into `SUMMARY.gateBypasses`.
- **Phase 215 — P0 escape retro: ledger-diff step in CLAUDE.md** ✓ (rec-20260724-002, `dec-20260724-001`) — "The Unlogged Audit Finding" failure-mode entry added to CLAUDE.md's Verification-honesty section, requiring an audit session to check every critical/P0 finding against `recommendations.json` before closing; backed by a doc-content test asserting the entry's key phrases.
- **Phase 216 — Close the trust envelope for `cadence_settle`** ✓ (rec-20260724-005) — `cadence_settle`'s MCP `run()` wrapped in the existing `gatedRun` trust-envelope check (same four checks already applied to the two `APPROVAL_BYPASS` tools); `enforceApprovalBypassGrant` renamed `enforceGatedToolGrant` since it now gates three tools, not two.
- **Phase 217 — CHANGELOG.md currency gate** ✓ (rec-20260724-003) — extends the existing `check-doc-sync.sh` (unmodified) to also require `CHANGELOG.md`'s newest `## [x.y.z]` heading match a version bump, at pre-commit and pre-push, mirroring the `CLAUDE.md` check exactly.
- **Phase 218 — Post-publish npm verification retry budget** ✓ (rec-20260725-001) — `release-integrity.mjs`'s `verifyNpmPackages` gets a distinctly more patient `POST_PUBLISH_VERIFY_ATTEMPTS=10` budget for the post-publish call only; `verifyNpmPublished`'s pre-publish fast-fail is untouched; fixes a real false-red on the v1.51.0 Release workflow run (30136637570) caused by npm CDN propagation lag.
- **Phase 219 — Recommendation id-minting cross-checks evidence.json** ✓ (rec-20260724-013) — `nextRecommendationId` now takes the max across `recommendations.json` AND `evidence.json`'s referenced `recommendationId`s for the date prefix, so a dangling evidence row can no longer collide with a freshly minted id; `cadence doctor` gains an orphaned-evidence check.
- **Phase 220 — Deepen the Praxis ledger into one module** ✓ (rec-20260725-002) — all five subject ledgers (recommendations/evidence/assumptions/decisions/milestones) now share one generic read/write/id-mint core (`store/ledger.ts`) with existing per-subject functions kept as thin wrappers; phase 219's cross-ledger id-collision safeguard generalizes to all four minting subjects; milestones reach parity in `intelligence audit`/`reconcile`/`stats` (new `orphan-milestone` finding kind) and gains the missing `{ mode: 0o600 }` write; a shared CLI list/filter pipeline replaces three independently maintained copies across `recommendation`/`decision`/`assumption` commands.
- **Phase 221 — MCP/CLI parity** ✓ (rec-20260725-003) — `cadence_recommendation_promote` now threads a `ref` argument into `shippedRef` (matching the CLI's `--ref`) and rejects it on non-shipped promotions; the duplicated "newly-proposed milestone" predicate collapses into one exported `hasNewlyProposedMilestone`; `next`/`verify`/`explain` relocate from `cli/commands/` into `services/` and get registered as MCP tools — tool count 18→22.


## Unreleased — dogfooding-driven hardening: adapter dedup, attestation, doctor coverage, convergent-review consolidation — phases 222–230 (settled, not yet published)

*Backfilled 2026-07-27 from the settled artifacts under `.cadence/phases/222–230`; those
artifacts are the record and were not modified. All 9 phases are confirmed on `main` via
`git log` (commits `1f70e66b`…`65bcd73d`) but sit **after** the `v1.51.1` tag — `npm view
@manehorizons/cadence-core version` still reports `1.51.1`. This work has not shipped in any
release yet; treat every bullet below as landed-but-unpublished, not as a future plan.*

This arc is a grab-bag of dogfooding-driven fixes and one deliberate consolidation push, mostly
sourced from friction the repo's own recent phases surfaced. Phase 222 is the biggest single
piece of mechanical work: it extracts the hook-routing/slash-command/install-merge/locate-self
logic that `host-claude-code` and `host-codex` had been duplicating into a new
`@manehorizons/cadence-host-toolkit` package, while deliberately keeping each adapter's payload-
extraction logic (`mapEvent`/`extractPayload`/`routeHookEvent`) local where the two hosts
genuinely differ — and along the way restores a previously-dropped `cadence-dispatch` dialogue
body that had silently regressed when Codex's command catalog diverged from the shared one.
Three phases close verification-honesty gaps directly: 223 gives `SUMMARY.json` a settle-time
sha256 content hash plus a `cadence summary verify` command so a hand-edited settled artifact is
now detectable (scope is detection only — signing is explicitly deferred behind
`rec-20260726-001`, parked on a threat-model rec per `dec-20260726-001`); 224 adds a `cadence
doctor` check, `ledger-remote-collision`, that fetches the tracked upstream and diffs new-
since-merge-base ledger ids on both sides to catch the exact cross-session `mintId` collision
class that had bitten a real session (see the memory `cadence-rec-id-collision-on-rebase`) —
detection only, no central id-issuing service, matching the repo's offline/zero-runtime-
dependency stance; and 226 closes three doc/provenance drifts around `gates.sealed` (docs
undercounted which gates consult it, two bypass-table rows were missing, and
`build-test-must-pass`/`boundary-scan` weren't recording skip-reason provenance the way
`test-coverage` does) with a doc-content test asserting the sealed-gate doc list is a superset
of every gate file that actually imports `isGateSealed`. Phase 225 is the arc's other big
mechanical piece: `nextConvergence()`'s surrounding read-sidecar → verify → classify → push-
history → write-sidecar → branch sequence, previously copy-pasted across `plan-review.ts`,
`code-review.ts`, and `spec-approve.ts` (twice), is now a single `runConvergentReview` primitive
all four call sites delegate to — a behavior-preserving refactor verified byte-identical against
16 characterization tests pinned before the extraction began. The remaining phases are point
fixes: 227 closes a dead-end hit live during phase 222 itself (a fresh `EnterWorktree` worktree
has `.cadence/` but no gitignored `state.json`, and `cadence init`'s refusal used to send the
user nowhere useful — both dead-ends now point at `cadence onboard`); 228 mechanically splits
the ~555-line `settleService` into 10 named, behavior-preserving step functions (precondition/
load, phase-collision backstop, gate-set resolution, `SettleContext` construction, evidence-
floor gate, state-commit/retro-offer, etc.) with zero test-file edits as the correctness proof;
229 adds a doc-content test guarding README's mermaid architecture diagram against drifting from
the real `VerifierProvider`/entry-surface set; and 230 fixes the built-in Python coverage
profile's opener regex, which previously produced zero coverage for an entire file when a test
function carried a `-> None:`-style return-type annotation. **No new DESIGN.md D-number** —
every phase here is additive/internal to existing models (host-adapter contract, gate/settle
pipeline, doctor check-set, convergence protocol).

- **Phase 222 — shared host-adapter toolkit** ✓ — new `@manehorizons/cadence-host-toolkit`
  package carries `routeHookEvent`, the slash-command catalog, `install.ts`'s managed-marker
  merge logic, and `locate-self.ts`, consumed by both `host-claude-code` and `host-codex`; each
  adapter's genuinely-divergent payload-extraction logic stays local. Restores a dropped
  `cadence-dispatch` dialogue body. Also adds `HostCapabilities.agentIdentification` so a host
  that can't confirm `agentId` (Codex, undocumented hook payload shape) is noticed loudly
  instead of silently, and wires `host-codex`'s CLI to actually populate it end-to-end.
- **Phase 223 — settle-time SUMMARY content hash + `cadence summary verify`** ✓
  (rec-20260724-006) — `computeSummaryContentHash` (canonical deep-key-sort + sha256) wired into
  `settle.ts` before every SUMMARY write, rendered into `SUMMARY.md`; new `cadence summary verify
  <phase> <num>` subcommand reports MATCH/MISMATCH/NO_HASH. Detection only — no signing, deferred
  to rec-20260726-001 per dec-20260726-001.
- **Phase 224 — `cadence doctor` ledger-remote-collision check** ✓ (rec-20260726-003) — fetches
  the tracked upstream (reusing `checkRemoteFreshness`), diffs local's and origin's new-since-
  merge-base recommendation/evidence/decision/assumption ids, warns on overlap; degrades to `ok`
  (never `error`) on no-repo/no-upstream/failed-fetch/detached-HEAD/no-merge-base. `manual`
  fixKind — no auto-repair, matching `worktree-phases`.
- **Phase 225 — shared `runConvergentReview` primitive** ✓ (rec-20260725-008) — extracts the
  read-sidecar → verify → `nextConvergence` → push-history → write-sidecar → branch sequence out
  of `plan-review.ts`, `code-review.ts`, and both `spec-approve.ts` call sites into one function;
  16 characterization tests pinned pre-refactor prove byte-identical sidecar JSON and per-site
  branching (`code-review`'s OR-bypass + try/catch preserved).
- **Phase 226 — centralize gate bypass and seal policy documentation + provenance** ✓ — fixes
  `docs/reference/config.md` and `docs/concepts.md`'s bypass table to name all 3 `gates.sealed`-
  consulting gates (was 2) and add the missing `--allow-failing-build`/
  `--allow-boundary-scan-failure` rows; adds a bypass-flag naming-policy subsection with
  git-log-verified dates correcting a stale claim about `--allow-failing-build`'s history;
  `build-test-must-pass`/`boundary-scan` now record skip-reason provenance in `registry.ts` like
  `test-coverage` already did.
- **Phase 227 — point missing-state.json errors at `cadence onboard`** ✓ (rec-20260726-002) —
  `SimpleStateBackend.readState()` and `cadence init`'s refusal now distinguish "`.cadence/`
  never initialized" from "`.cadence/` exists but `state.json` is missing" (the fresh-worktree
  shape) and route the latter to `cadence onboard` instead of a dead-end `cadence init` retry.
  Message-routing only — `init` still refuses and exits non-zero; `onboard`'s bootstrap logic
  untouched.
- **Phase 228 — split `settleService` into named step functions** ✓ (rec-20260725-007) —
  mechanical extraction of the ~555-line function's ~9-10 concerns (precondition/load,
  phase-collision backstop, gate-set/banner/soft-cap, `SettleContext` construction via a new
  `buildSettleContext` factory, gate-loop refusal SUMMARY, AC-result derivation, anomaly/skill-
  audit, evidence-floor gate, summary/retro/promotion, state-commit/retro-offer) into named
  step functions within the same file; zero test-file edits, `SettleArgs`/`CommandResult`
  signature unchanged.
- **Phase 229 — README architecture-diagram doc-test** ✓ (rec-20260726-004) — new
  `readme-architecture-diagram.test.ts` guards README's mermaid diagram's named
  `VerifierProvider` values and entry-surface list against drifting from code truth.
- **Phase 230 — python coverage opener recognizes return-type annotations** ✓ — widened the
  OPENER regex to accept an optional `-> <return type>` group before the trailing colon on
  `def`/`async def` test functions, which previously produced zero coverage for the whole file;
  4 regression tests added (plain, async, class-method, richer-type). Audited `js-ts.ts` for the
  analogous gap and confirmed it doesn't apply (that opener matches the `it(`/`test(` call token,
  not the callback signature).


### Numbering ledger — phases 118–230 (backfilled 2026-07-27)

Six phase numbers in this range have no directory under `.cadence/phases/`. They are
recorded here so a future reader does not read the gap as missing data.

- **125, 126, 127, 128** — never used. No directory, no commit, no artifact. Numbers
  burned during parallel drafting (the phase-collision guard's contract is refuse +
  suggest `max(observed)+1`, so a collision costs a number). Nothing shipped under them.
- **172** — no trace anywhere: not on disk, not in `git log`. Same class as 125–128,
  with no corroborating incident.
- **175** — **real work, no artifact.** Commit `docs: README leads with the test-gutting
  demo (phase 175) (#188)` is on `main`, and phase 177's DRAFT names "phase 175's PR
  #188" as the stale-branch incident it reverted. The phase directory was lost with the
  stale branch. Phase 177 restored the outcome; see arc G.


## v1.52.0 (planned) — Assurance manifest: settle can tell mock from real — NEXT

Sourced from the Phase 0 assurance/kernel/criteria-anchored-review spec
(`docs/handoffs/cadence-phase0-assurance-kernel-review.md`) and 11 recommendations filed
2026-07-27 (`rec-20260727-001` through `-011`, scout `scout-20260727-kernel-review-phase0`).
Closes CADENCE's sole surviving P0: **settle cannot currently distinguish a `mock`-verified
review from a real one.** `CodeReviewResult` already carries `provider` and `model`
(`packages/core/src/verify/code-review.ts:30`), and `GateProvenanceZ`
(`packages/types/src/summary.ts:63`) records only `{gate, status, skipReason, reason}` — so
the identity of *who verified* is computed and then thrown away at persistence. A SUMMARY
that says `code-review: ran` is indistinguishable between a real Anthropic review and the
deterministic mock that flags `console.log`.

Slice 1 (phases 232–233) is **unconditionally valuable standalone** — it closes the P0 even
if slices 2–4 are abandoned, which the spec's own tripwires explicitly permit. Two prep
phases land first, unrelated to the assurance theme but staged here: Phase 231 (the
`roadmap-currency` doctor check) so this arc doesn't repeat the mistake it's part of fixing,
and Phase 238 (drop Node 20 support) — filed 2026-07-27 during the same session, ahead of
kernel work starting. Neither blocks the other; the operator picks build order.

### Phase 231 — `cadence doctor` check: roadmap-currency (rec-20260727-012)

> **As built (2026-08-07).** Shipped as **phase 259**, not phase 231 — by the time this
> phase's DRAFT was scaffolded, 259 was the next free phase number (231 had long since been
> taken by unrelated work). The file plan below is also stale: doctor checks turned out not
> to live under a `checks/` subdirectory with a separate `registry.ts` — every check is
> inline in `packages/core/src/doctor/run.ts`, one per exported function, each with its own
> test file under `packages/core/tests/doctor/`. Phase 259 followed that real architecture:
> `packages/core/src/doctor/run.ts` (`checkRoadmapCurrency`, `ROADMAP_DRIFT_WARN_THRESHOLD =
> 10`), `packages/core/tests/doctor/roadmap-currency.test.ts` (new), and the `docs/reference/
> commands.md` doc edit (AC-5) — all five ACs below shipped as specified, including the
> `min`-across-files semantics of AC-1, refined during BUILD to explicitly *exclude* (not
> zero-out) a reference file with no `Phase N` headings at all, so a repo that only maintains
> one of the two files doesn't warn forever. The `release-cut` skill step in the file list
> below was deliberately dropped — out of scope, undecided follow-up, not one of the five ACs.

**Objective.** Add a warning-only, non-blocking `cadence doctor` check comparing the
highest phase number under `.cadence/phases/` against the highest phase number referenced
in `ROADMAP.md`/`MILESTONES.md`; warn when drift exceeds a threshold. Deliberately
`fixId: null` — generating roadmap prose is exactly what must not be automated. Ships as its
own small phase, ahead of Phase 0's Slice 1, so the anti-recurrence mechanism is live before
new phase numbers start accumulating again.

**Files.**
- `packages/core/src/cli/commands/doctor/checks/roadmap-currency.ts` (new) —
  `checkRoadmapCurrency(root): Promise<DoctorCheck>`, `ROADMAP_DRIFT_WARN_THRESHOLD = 10`.
- `packages/core/src/cli/commands/doctor/registry.ts` (or wherever checks register) —
  wire the new check in.
- `packages/core/tests/cli/doctor-roadmap-currency.test.ts` (new).
- `docs/reference/commands.md` — `doctor` section, paired doc edit.
- `.cadence/skills/release-cut` (or equivalent) — add the roadmap-index-currency step
  adjacent to the existing doc-sync verification step.

**ACs.** (1) `cadence doctor` reports the drift between the highest on-disk phase number and
the highest referenced in ROADMAP.md/MILESTONES.md (using `min` across the two files, so
catching up one file doesn't mask the other). (2) Drift ≤ 10 → pass; drift > 10 → warning,
never a hard failure, `fixId: null`. (3) The check degrades to a silent pass when
`.cadence/phases/` is empty or ROADMAP.md is still the `init` stub — a fresh consumer repo
never sees this warning. (4) Best-effort: any read failure reports "not determinable" rather
than throwing, matching `checkPhaseFreshness`'s existing idiom. (5) Paired doc edit in
`docs/reference/commands.md`'s `doctor` section.

### Phase 238 — Drop Node 20 support; raise engine floor to Node >=22 (rec-20260727-013)

**Objective.** Retire the Node 20 CI leg and the `engines.node` floor across all five
published packages plus `host-toolkit`, landing before Phase 0's kernel/assurance work
begins. Unrelated to that arc's theme — grouped here only as pre-Phase-0 staging, same
role as Phase 231 — and may ship in its own release rather than bundled with the
assurance-manifest work depending on how release-cut timing falls.

**Files.**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — matrix `node: [20, 22]` → `node: [22]` (6 test jobs → 3
  across ubuntu/macos/windows).
- `.github/workflows/security.yml` — the standalone `sbom` job's `node-version: 20` →
  `22` for consistency (unrelated to the test matrix; just a tool-runner pin).
- `package.json`, `packages/{core,types,host-claude-code,host-codex,host-toolkit}/package.json`
  — `engines.node` `">=20"` → `">=22"`.
- `packages/core/src/cli/node-guard.ts` — `checkNodeMajor`'s default `min = 20` → `22`.
- `packages/core/tests/cli/node-guard.test.ts` — update the ~4 assertions/descriptions
  pinned to the Node-20 floor.
- Root `package.json` — `@types/node` `^20.14.0` → `^22.x`.
- `.github/dependabot.yml` — reword the `@types/node` major-bump `ignore` rule + its
  comment, which currently ties the exemption to the Node-20 floor explicitly.
- `CLAUDE.md` (2 spots), `README.md`, `website/src/content/docs/start/install.md` — manual
  prose sweep of "Node 20 + 22" mentions. **Not doc-test-gated** — no test asserts the
  literal string "20" — so this is manual diligence, not an automated check.

**Boundaries.** Do NOT touch `CHANGELOG.md`, `.cadence/ROADMAP.md`/`MILESTONES.md`, or any
`.cadence/phases/**` DRAFT/SPEC/SUMMARY artifact that mentions Node 20 — those are frozen
historical records, not current-state docs.

**ACs.** (1) CI matrix runs only Node 22 across all three OSes; `ci-success` still passes.
(2) All six `engines.node` fields read `>=22`; a changeset is filed since this is a real
breaking change for consumers still on Node 20. (3) `checkNodeMajor` and its tests reflect
the new floor. (4) `dependabot.yml`'s `@types/node` ignore rule and comment match the new
floor's rationale. (5) The four named current-state docs no longer say "Node 20"; historical
docs/artifacts are untouched. (6) `pnpm turbo run lint typecheck test build` green.

### Phase 232 — Gate provenance carries verifier identity; SUMMARY schemaVersion 2 (rec-20260727-001)

**Objective.** Stop discarding verifier identity at persistence. Enrich `GateProvenanceZ`
with the verifier family and model that actually ran a gate, and thread the already-computed
`provider`/`model` from `CodeReviewResult` (and the security-audit equivalent) through to the
persisted provenance entry instead of dropping them. This is a SUMMARY shape change, so bump
`SummaryZ.schemaVersion` from the literal `1` to `1|2`: writers emit `2`, readers accept both,
and a pre-parse probe reads the raw `schemaVersion` before Zod validation so an unknown
*higher* version reports "written by a newer Cadence" rather than a corruption error. Zero
`GATE_ORDER` changes; no gate behavior changes; no new refusals. Purely: the record stops
lying by omission.

**Files.**
- `packages/types/src/summary.ts` — `GateProvenanceZ` gains optional verifier-identity
  fields; `SummaryZ.schemaVersion` becomes `z.union([z.literal(1), z.literal(2)])`.
- `packages/core/src/gates/code-review.ts` + `security-audit.ts` — pass the result's
  `provider`/`model` into the provenance entry rather than discarding them.
- `packages/core/src/services/settle.ts` (provenance persistence step, per phase 228's named
  step functions) — write `schemaVersion: 2`.
- SUMMARY reader — pre-parse `schemaVersion` probe + newer-version diagnostic.
- `packages/core/tests/**` — round-trip on a v1 fixture, a v2 fixture, and an unknown v3.
- `docs/concepts.md` (SUMMARY provenance) — paired doc edit.

**ACs.** (1) A `code-review` gate run by a real provider persists that provider's family and
model in its `GateProvenanceZ` entry; a `mock` run persists `mock` — the two SUMMARY records
are distinguishable. (2) Same for `security-audit`. (3) New settles write `schemaVersion: 2`;
every pre-existing `schemaVersion: 1` SUMMARY still parses unchanged (additive-schema rule).
(4) A SUMMARY carrying an unrecognized higher `schemaVersion` produces a "written by a newer
Cadence" diagnostic, not a parse/corruption error. (5) `GATE_ORDER`, gate verdicts, and
refusal behavior are byte-for-byte unchanged — this phase adds no gate and changes no
outcome.

### Phase 233 — Per-settle assurance record (rec-20260728-001)

> **As built (2026-07-28):** this heading originally cited `rec-20260727-002`, which was a
> mislabel — that rec's actual content (SUMMARY `schemaVersion` 1|2 forward-compat) was
> already delivered by phase 232 (AC-3/AC-4) and has been promoted to `shipped` against it.
> The recommendation actually describing this phase's scope was never filed separately; it
> is now filed as `rec-20260728-001`.

**Objective.** With verifier identity persisted (phase 232), compute one **assurance
record** per settle: a derived, whole-run answer to "how strongly was this settle actually
verified?", composed from the per-gate verifier identities plus the existing per-AC
`AcEvidenceZ` ranking (`ai-verified > executed > assertion > mention > unverified`). The
record is *derived and reported*, not a new gate — it adds no refusal and no bypass flag.
Its job is to make a settle whose gates all ran under `mock` visibly different, in the
durable record, from one verified for real. This phase is also where the spec's first
tripwire is evaluated.

**Files.**
- `packages/types/src/summary.ts` — the assurance-record schema, on `SummaryZ` (optional, so
  v2 SUMMARYs without it stay valid).
- `packages/core/src/gates/` — a pure derivation over the gate provenance array + AC evidence
  classes; no I/O, no gate registration.
- `packages/core/src/services/settle.ts` — one named step that computes and attaches it.
- SUMMARY renderer + `cadence summary verify` (phase 223's attestation) — surface it.
- `packages/core/tests/**`; `docs/concepts.md` — paired doc edit.

**ACs.** (1) Every settle writes an assurance record derived from persisted gate provenance +
per-AC evidence classes. (2) An all-`mock` run and an equivalent real-provider run produce
**different** assurance records for an otherwise identical phase. (3) The derivation is a
pure function of the provenance + evidence arrays — no gate-specific special-casing (this AC
*is* the tripwire; see below). (4) Settle's pass/refuse outcome is unchanged — the record is
reported, never gating. (5) The record is covered by phase 223's settle-time content hash, so
it cannot be edited post-settle without invalidating the attestation.

> **Tripwire (from the spec, binding).** If AC-3 cannot be met — if the assurance record
> requires gate-specific special cases to express — **stop after phase 233 and abandon
> slices 2–4.** Slice 1 is standalone-valuable; the later slices are premised on the
> boundary being real, and a special-cased manifest is the evidence that it is not. Record
> the outcome in the phase SUMMARY's decisions, and strike phases 234–237 below.

### Phase 234 — Kernel / verifier / consumer boundary, lint-enforced *(built on `feat/kernel-assurance-v2`, merged to `main` 2026-08-01 via #353)*

**Gate to entry.** Phase 233 settled with AC-3 met (no gate-specific special cases).

**Objective (sketch).** The kernel/verifier/consumer split is already ~80% built and
unnamed. Name the three as published contracts and add a lint rule that fails the build on
an internal-import violation across them. **No package moves, no distribution work, zero
`GATE_ORDER` changes** — this is naming and enforcing a boundary that already exists, in the
same spirit as the core→host arrow. Maps to rec-20260727-003 (medium). Files/ACs at DRAFT
time.

> **Tripwire (from the spec, binding).** If the boundary extraction runs beyond a couple of
> focused sessions, **revert it.** Overrun is the diagnosis, not a schedule problem: it means
> this is a rewrite wearing a refactor's clothes, and the premise that the boundary is
> already 80% built was wrong.

> **As built (2026-07-28, `0726e405`).** Tripwire did not trip. Shipped as sketched: the
> three roles named as published contracts and an ESLint rule added failing the build on an
> internal-import violation across them. Zero `GATE_ORDER` changes, zero gate-behavior
> changes, per the objective's own constraint.

### Phase 235 — Criteria-anchored review verifier: input + anchor ladder *(built on `feat/kernel-assurance-v2`, merged to `main` 2026-08-01 via #353)*

**Gate to entry.** Phase 234 landed without tripping its overrun tripwire.

**Objective (sketch).** `CodeReviewInput` is `{ files, diff }`
(`packages/core/src/verify/code-review.ts:22`) — the review verifier **cannot see the
DRAFT's acceptance criteria at all**, so it reviews code against general good practice rather
than against what the phase committed to. Extend the input with ACs, boundaries, and task
refs, and implement the anchor ladder (`executable > structured > declared >
undeclared/criteria-gap`) so each finding is classified by the strength of the criterion it
anchors to — including emitting explicit **criteria-gap** findings where the diff does work
no AC covers. Maps to rec-20260727-004, rec-20260727-005 (medium, `needs-decision`).

> **As built (2026-07-29, `c27bcb03`).** Shipped as sketched: `CodeReviewInput` extended
> with ACs/boundaries/task refs, the anchor ladder implemented
> (`executable > structured > declared > undeclared/criteria-gap`), and criteria-gap
> findings emitted for unanchored work above the severity floor. Phase 241 later made the
> ladder's `executable` tier reachable in a live settle (it shipped structurally in 235 but
> wasn't yet exercised end-to-end).

### Phase 236 — Finding identity, disposition, and ledger routing *(built on `feat/kernel-assurance-v2`, merged to `main` 2026-08-01 via #353 — see "As built" note below)*

**Gate to entry.** Phase 235 settled, **and** rec-20260727-007 (shared fingerprint primitive
extraction from Déjà, `needs-evidence`) is resolved — stable finding identity is its
dependent, and building a bespoke fingerprint before that investigation lands is how two
incompatible ones get shipped.

> **Gate satisfied (2026-07-30).** Phase 235 settled as `c27bcb03`, and the
> rec-20260727-007 investigation closed: rec **rejected**, `dec-20260730-001` records that
> finding identity uses a pure anchor-derived content hash over
> `(file, anchor.kind, anchor.ref, severity, normalized message)` — no fingerprint
> primitive is extracted, and no runtime dependency is added. Evidence in
> `ev-20260730-001`. **Phase 236 is unblocked and must not build a fingerprint.**

**Objective (sketch).** Give findings a stable identity (id + target discriminant), a
disposition, and expiring waivers, then route them to the recommendation ledger — which
requires extending `RecommendationSourceZ` (`packages/types/src/intelligence.ts:3`,
currently `manual | code-analysis | impact | cadence | session`) with a `review` member.
Maps to rec-20260727-006, rec-20260727-011 (medium, `needs-decision`).

> **As built (2026-07-30).** This slice shipped the schema and computation half of the
> objective, not the routing half. Landed: `FindingZ` gains `id`/`target`/`disposition`/
> `waiver` (additive, optional, back-compat verified — `packages/types/src/summary.ts`);
> `id` is a pure content hash over `(file, anchor.kind, anchor.ref, severity, normalized
> message)`, never a line number (`packages/core/src/verify/finding-identity.ts`);
> `AnchorZ.kind` widens to include `'invariant'` (unused by any producer yet — phase 237
> scope); and the two independently-declared `Finding` types (the persisted-schema
> `FindingZ` and `verify/code-review.ts`'s local 3-severity type) converge onto one,
> discriminated by `target`, per source-doc local D9. `RecommendationSourceZ` gains
> `'review'` (schema-only). **Findings-to-ledger auto-routing — creating `Recommendation` +
> `Evidence` entries from findings during settle — was explicitly NOT implemented in this
> slice.** That is real behavioral I/O-port-threading work (a settle-time writer, not a
> schema change), and was split to a follow-on phase. **That follow-on is phase 242
> (below), which shipped it 2026-07-31.**

### Phase 242 — Findings-to-ledger auto-routing (rec-20260731-003)

**Gate to entry.** Phase 236 settled: `id`/`target`/`disposition`/`waiver` identity exists on
`FindingZ`, and `RecommendationSourceZ` already carries the `'review'` member, schema-only,
per the phase 236 "As built" amendment above.

**Objective.** Implement the behavioral half phase 236 deliberately deferred — the source
design doc's §7.3 (`docs/handoffs/cadence-phase0-assurance-kernel-review.md`): route
identified code-review findings into the recommendation ledger at settle time as
`Recommendation`/`Evidence` entries, keyed on `Finding.id` so a re-settle of an unchanged
phase never mints a duplicate entry for the same finding, and batched under one `scoutId`
per settle rather than one per finding. Findings with no stable id (security-audit; identity
is not wired in there) are skipped, never force-routed. Settle-time writer only — no new
gate, no `GATE_ORDER` change, no refusal semantics, and no disposition-mutation CLI (still a
follow-on phase's surface, per phase 236's own boundary). Maps to rec-20260731-003.

> **Design decision (`dec-20260731-001`).** rec-20260731-001 found that `computeFindingId`
> collapses two distinct findings that share `(file, anchor.kind, anchor.ref, severity,
> normalized message)` with no occurrence discriminant. Resolved without touching the
> identity hash: the routing step merges same-id findings within one settle into a single
> `Recommendation`, recording the occurrence count explicitly in its evidence/summary text —
> a deliberate merge-by-identity semantic, not silent data loss.

**Files.**
- `packages/types/src/intelligence.ts` — `RecommendationZ.sourceFindingId` (optional FK back
  to the routed `Finding.id`).
- `packages/types/src/config.ts` — `recommendations.autoRoute` (`boolean`, default `true`),
  alongside the existing `autoArchive`.
- `packages/core/src/intelligence/store/recommendations.ts` — `addRecommendation` extended
  with an optional `source` / `sourceFindingId` / structured `cadence-artifact` evidence
  override.
- `packages/core/src/intelligence/finding-routing.ts` (new) — the pure derivation,
  `deriveRoutingCandidates`.
- `packages/core/src/services/settle.ts` — one named step in `finalizeAndCloseSettle`, wired
  in right after the SUMMARY is written, best-effort and config-gated.
- `packages/core/tests/**`; `docs/concepts.md`, `docs/reference/config.md` — paired doc edit.

> **As built — one file beyond the list above.** `packages/core/src/verify/finding-identity.ts`
> (phase 236) gained one line: `normalizeMessage` widened from module-private to `export`, no
> change to any hash input. Independent review of T2 (the routing derivation) surfaced that
> routing must embed the same whitespace-normalized message `computeFindingId` hashed over, or
> a routed ledger entry would disagree with its own identity — reusing phase 236's existing
> normalization function was the fix, in preference to duplicating it.

**As built (2026-07-31).** Shipped as designed. `deriveRoutingCandidates`
(`packages/core/src/intelligence/finding-routing.ts`) groups findings by id first (merging
same-id occurrences per `dec-20260731-001` and recording the occurrence count), skips
un-identified findings, and mints exactly one `scoutId` per settle batch.
`finalizeAndCloseSettle` (`packages/core/src/services/settle.ts`) wires it in gated on
`recommendations.autoRoute`, reads both the active and archived ledger arrays to dedup across
re-settles (a previously-routed finding can already be soft-archived by `autoArchive` before a
re-settle), and never blocks or fails settle on a routing failure — a stderr notice fires
instead, matching the existing retro-digest step's shape. `GATE_ORDER` and every gate's
pass/refuse verdict are byte-for-byte unchanged. Disposition mutation (accept / waive / fix /
supersede) still has no CLI surface, and `security-audit` findings still have no identity
wired in — both stay follow-on scope, per phase 236's boundary.

## Backfilled: phases 243–256 (2026-08-06)

Phases 243–256 were built and shipped but never written up here — a live gap this
entry closes. `rec-20260727-012` (`cadence doctor` roadmap-currency check, Phase 231
above) would have caught this drift automatically; it was only ever filed
(`#322`), never built, so nothing flagged it. Still open — see the note after
Phase 256.

## v1.53.0 — Kernel-assurance-v2 arc merge — ✓ SHIPPED 2026-08-01

Bundles phases 232–236, 241–245 (10 changesets, PR #355). 244–245 (and the arc's
earlier phases 232–236, 241) were built on `feat/kernel-assurance-v2`, merged to
`main` via `18296088`; 243 shipped straight to `main` the day before (PR #344) and
is folded into this release as "the mock-banner follow-up."

### Phase 243 — Loud banner on every verifier seam's credential-missing downgrade (rec-20260731-002)

**Objective.** `createVerifierFactory`'s three selection-time degrade branches
(anthropic: no key; local: no baseURL/model; host-cli: builder unwired) emitted
only a bare one-line stderr warning, unlike deep-verify's loud
`MOCK_FALLBACK_BANNER`. Elevate those three branches to the same loud-banner
treatment, naming the seam and the missing prerequisite, without touching the
silent default-mock fallthrough.

**Files.** `packages/core/src/verify/verifier-factory.ts`;
`packages/core/tests/verify/verifier-factory.test.ts`; `docs/providers.md`;
`.changeset/mock-fallback-banner-all-seams.md`.

**As built (2026-07-31).** Shipped as designed — `buildDowngradeBanner()` reuses
`MOCK_VERIFIER_NOTICE` wording, wired into all three degrade branches.
`settle-mock-banner.test.ts`'s disjointness assertions updated since factory- and
settle.ts-level banners now legitimately share phrasing. Full workspace green.
Flagged, left untouched: `docs/providers.md`'s "Current scope" section claims
5/7 seams lack host-cli wiring — verified false (all 7 wired), pre-existing doc
drift, out of scope. PR #344.

### Phase 244 — Settle-time guard for global-CLI-shadowing-branch build (rec-20260729-001)

**Objective.** `cadence settle` could silently write a downgraded SUMMARY
(schemaVersion 1, no assurance record) when actually executed by a
globally-installed `cadence` binary predating the repo's own build (confirmed on
phases 233/234 — both binaries report identical `--version` strings). Add a
realpath-based self-check that fires a loud stderr notice and records provenance
on the SUMMARY when the executing binary isn't inside this repo's own worktree.

**Files.** `packages/core/src/services/settle.ts` (new
`detectForeignCadenceBinary`, `isPathInside`, `resolveForeignBinaryFacts`);
`packages/types/src/summary.ts` (new optional field);
`packages/core/src/verify/verifier-factory.ts`; tests
`settle-binary-guard.test.ts`, `settle-foreign-binary-wiring.test.ts`;
`docs/concepts.md`; changeset.

**As built (2026-08-01).** Shipped as designed; also fixed a coverage-attribution
bug where a literal `AC-N` token in a test file's header comment shadowed a real
asserting block. PR #348, with a follow-up commit (PR #349) promoting
rec-20260729-001 to shipped. Built on `feat/kernel-assurance-v2`.

### Phase 245 — Finding-identity hash: drop anchor + severity volatility (rec-20260801-009)

**Objective.** `computeFindingId` hashed `anchor.kind`/`anchor.ref`/`severity`
alongside file+message, but both can legitimately change for the same underlying
defect (DRAFT-amendment re-anchoring; live LLM severity classification), minting
duplicate ledger recommendations. Narrow identity to `(file, normalized
message)` only and fix `deriveRoutingCandidates`'s merge logic, which had
assumed severity was invariant within a matched-id group.

**Files.** `packages/core/src/verify/finding-identity.ts`;
`packages/core/src/intelligence/finding-routing.ts` (new `SEVERITY_RANK`); tests
`finding-identity.test.ts`, `criteria-anchor-corpus.test.ts`,
`finding-routing.test.ts`; `docs/concepts.md`.

**As built (2026-08-01).** Shipped as designed across all 5 ACs. Also corrected
stale comments in `finding-routing.ts` claiming a matched group "already agrees
on severity by construction" (no longer true post-fix) and `docs/concepts.md`'s
old 5-input identity formula. Full core suite green (381/381 files, 3491/3491
tests). PR #352. Built on `feat/kernel-assurance-v2`.

## v1.54.0 — npm scope rename + post-gate refusal durability — ✓ SHIPPED 2026-08-02

Bundles phases 246–250 (7 commits since v1.53.0, PR #363).

### Phase 246 — Finding-identity dedup under real-provider message drift (rec-20260801-010)

**Objective.** Decide, on evidence not assumption, whether finding-identity
dedup under real-LLM message drift needs code now.

**Files.** `.cadence/intelligence/decisions.json`,
`.cadence/intelligence/recommendations.json` only — no source code.

**As built (2026-08-01) — decision-only, major scope change mid-BUILD.** After
independent review found the original in-loop-telemetry design measured the
wrong axis (intra-batch, not cross-settle), the phase was revised to a
decision-only outcome. Recorded `dec-20260801-003`: 0/257 SUMMARY.json files had
ever carried a persisted code-review finding; the pre-committed next step is an
offline analyzer over the accumulated SUMMARY corpus (not in-loop telemetry or
fuzzy-matching); revisit trigger is ≥3 non-mock-provider settles each persisting
≥1 finding. Shipped via `--evidence-floor-bypass` (no test file exists for a
decision-only phase; AC-1 verified via `cadence decision show` instead). Filed
rec-20260801-011 (refused-settle SUMMARY overwrite, → phase 247) separately.
PR #356.

### Phase 247 — Preserve refused-settle findings: additive per-attempt SUMMARY sibling (rec-20260801-011, rec-20260801-005)

**Objective.** `writeRefusedSettleSummary` never recorded the code-review/
security-audit findings that caused a refusal, and even once recorded, a later
attempt for the same draft overwrote the record. Fix both: record, then
protect.

**Files.** `packages/core/src/services/settle.ts` (`writeRefusedSettleSummary`
extended; new `now?: () => string` clock seam);
`packages/core/tests/services/settle.test.ts`;
`packages/core/src/services/summary-verify.ts`;
`packages/core/src/cli/commands/summary.ts`; `docs/reference/commands.md`;
`docs/concepts.md`.

**As built (2026-08-02).** Shipped as designed — refused SUMMARYs now
conditionally carry `codeReview`/`securityAudit` findings and a `contentHash`,
plus an immutable `<draftId>-refused-<timestamp>-SUMMARY-snapshot.{json,md}`
sibling (deliberately not matching `-SUMMARY.json` discovery patterns so
MCP/git-diff tooling never picks it up). Full suite green (390/390 files,
3592/3592 tests). PR #357.

### Phase 248 — Honest bypassed-verifier provenance for code-review/security-audit throws (rec-20260801-004)

**Objective.** A code-review/security-audit verifier *throw* (not a
findings-based bypass) bypassed via `--allow-*-failure`/`--force` recorded a
bare `status: 'ran'` with no identity — dishonest, since the call never
returned. Should record `status: 'skipped'` naming the flag and the failure.

**Files.** `packages/core/src/gates/types.ts` (new `reviewVerifierFailure`
`GateFlags` field); `packages/core/src/gates/code-review.ts`,
`security-audit.ts`, `registry.ts`; corresponding test files;
`docs/concepts.md`.

**As built (2026-08-02).** Shipped as designed, all 5 ACs pass. Symmetric fix
across both gates; the existing findings-bypass path (real HIGH/CRITICAL
findings on a completed call) deliberately left untouched since `status: 'ran'`
is accurate there. PR #358.

### Phase 249 — Post-gate refusal SUMMARYs + finding-durability ledger closeout (rec-20260731-010, rec-20260712-006)

**Objective.** Extend phase 247's refused-SUMMARY writer to the three remaining
post-gate refusal families (AC-derivation, anomaly/skill-audit, evidence-floor)
that still exited 1 with no SUMMARY, plus close out finding-durability ledger
bookkeeping.

**Files.** `packages/core/src/services/settle.ts` (3 call-site reroutes only, no
signature changes); `packages/core/tests/cli/settle-auto.test.ts`,
`settle-skill-audit.test.ts`, `settle-interactive.test.ts`,
`packages/core/tests/services/settle.test.ts`; `docs/concepts.md`.

**As built (2026-08-02).** Shipped as designed. Build-time correction: a grep
missed a third absence-assertion (`settle-interactive.test.ts:180-182`) because
its `existsSync`/`.toBe(false)` spanned two lines — same refusal family, flipped
along with the other two. Also missed `checkPhaseCollisionBackstop`'s
worktree-collision refusal (bare `{exitCode:1}` shape, out of scope by design).
Shipped with two gate bypasses: `--allow-missing-coverage` (test-coverage) and
`--evidence-floor-bypass` on AC-1 (ledger-state verified via CLI output, no test
can carry the token — phase 246 precedent). PR #361.

### Phase 250 — Rename npm scope to `@thomas-powers-jr`

**Objective.** Rename the monorepo's npm scope from `@manehorizons` to
`@thomas-powers-jr` across source, config, docs, and tooling, matching the
already-renamed GitHub org (PR #360). Publish-ready but does not publish (npm
publish/deprecate are operator-run post-merge). Also closes a real gap:
`cadence doctor --fix` couldn't detect a hook still pointing at the old scope
(marker-presence only, not command-content).

**Files.** All 6 `package.json`s + `pnpm-lock.yaml`; 178 source files' import
specifiers; `host-wire.ts`, both adapters' `install.ts`, `doctor/fix.ts`,
`doctor/host-hooks.ts`, `doctor/run.ts`; `config-explain/{gather,build,types}.ts`;
~290 test files; `CLAUDE.md`, all READMEs, `.changeset/config.json`,
`scripts/release-integrity.mjs`; new `docs/migration-npm-scope.md`; GitHub issue
template + 3 workflow files.

**As built (2026-08-02).** Largest of these 14 phases (16 tasks, tier `complex`,
soft-cap bypassed via `--allow-auto-complex`). Grew via as-built amendments
(T9–T16) found by independent review and a whole-branch review: two tasks fixed
doctor's and config-explain's stale-scope messages, which had promised detection
(AC-5) but never actually branched on the new predicate for two of three
promised callers; another phase-qualified all AC-coverage tokens
(`.cadence/config.json`'s `coverageScheme` requires `250-01/AC-N`, not bare
`AC-N`) and closed 2 real coverage gaps (AC-2, AC-7) with honest new assertions
rather than bypasses. Final state: 392/392 test files, 3627/3627 tests green.
PR #362.

## Unreleased — v1.55.0 integrity release in progress — phases 251–256

Scope, priorities, and standing rules for this arc are tracked in
`docs/handoffs/HANDOFF-v1.55-integrity-release.md`. Phase 251 shipped ahead of
that handoff being written; 252–256 map to its lettered phases C, A, B, D, E
respectively (letters F–J are not yet phases).

### Phase 251 — Conduction reachability check + finding-durability arc close-out (rec-20260801-012)

**Objective.** Close the finding-durability arc's ledger bookkeeping (phases
247–249, shipped v1.54.0), then add a `cadence doctor` check
(`conduction-reachability`) reporting per-gate/per-axis (profile, provider,
session) whether this repo's config can produce a real-provider code-review/
security-audit finding at all — three verified blockers currently make it
structurally unreachable in normal headless-agent operation.

**Files.** `packages/core/src/doctor/run.ts` (new inline check,
`severity: 'warning'`, `fixId: null`); `docs/reference/commands.md`;
`docs/providers.md`; `.cadence/intelligence/{recommendations,decisions,evidence}.json`;
new `packages/core/tests/docs/phase251-ledger.test.ts`.

**As built (2026-08-03).** Shipped as designed, all 6 ACs pass. Ledger closeout:
`rec-20260802-001` promoted to shipped (ref "v1.54.0 (phases 247/248/249)");
filed a new low-priority gap rec noting no CLI path corrects a `shippedRef` on
an already-terminal recommendation. Recorded `dec-20260803-001`: self-invocation
guard retained (safety property), auto-profile gate set unchanged (deliberate
cost decision), security-audit's mock default is a separate ordinary config
choice, conduction is a documented human-operator procedure. Deliberately does
not modify `isSelfInvocation`/`DELTAS`. PR #366.

### Phase 252 — Self-application config correction (rec-20260804-005)

**Objective.** Raise the repo's own `gates.evidenceFloor` from `"mention"` to
the `solo` preset's `"assertion"` default, and record a decision deferring the
baseline `profile` question to v1.56 Phase P, without superseding
`dec-20260803-001`.

**Files.** `.cadence/config.json`; `.cadence/intelligence/decisions.json`,
`DECISIONS.md`; new `packages/core/tests/docs/self-application-config.test.ts`.

**As built (2026-08-04).** Shipped exactly as designed, both ACs pass. `profile`
deliberately left at `"auto"`; `securityAudit.provider` left at `"mock"`.
Recorded `dec-20260804-001`. Captured `conduction-reachability` doctor output
confirming it stayed `warning`/unchanged — correct outcome, nothing about
reachability should move from this phase. Full suite green (394/394 files,
3639/3639 tests). PR #372.

### Phase 253 — Dependency override remediation

**Objective.** Corrected premise: pnpm's `overrides` mechanism was never
broken — the misleading warning came from a newer globally-installed pnpm
launcher self-switching before delegating to the pinned 9.12.0. The real
defect: override targets (fast-uri, brace-expansion 2.x/5.x lines) were stale,
`ip-address` had no override at all, and nothing detected drift. Refresh
targets, add the missing override, add a CI detector, and correct the false
narrative in-place.

**Files.** `package.json` (`pnpm.overrides`), `pnpm-lock.yaml`; new
`scripts/check-lockfile-overrides.mjs`; `.github/workflows/security.yml`;
`packages/core/tests/docs/check-lockfile-overrides.test.ts`, `security-ci.test.ts`;
`docs/security/audit-exceptions.md`; `docs/handoffs/HANDOFF-v1.55-integrity-release.md`;
`CLAUDE.md`.

**As built (2026-08-05).** Tier `complex`, soft-cap bypassed
(`--allow-auto-complex`). All 6 ACs pass with a documented AC-3 framing
correction (the "revert to stale value" example doesn't demonstrate failure
within a major version; the detector's real failure modes are a *tightened*
target and a *removed/uncovered* override key). Shipped brace-expansion
2.x/ip-address as caret ranges rather than the DRAFT's literal `>=`, after
empirically finding an unbounded `>=` collapsed the 2.x line into the unrelated
5.x line's resolution. Filed rec-20260805-001 (low, `docs.yml`'s stale
`pnpm/action-setup@v4` vs `@v6` elsewhere) and rec-20260805-002 (low, detector
can't catch a stale-but-internally-consistent floor). PR #373. Corrects
`rec-20260724-012`, which was filed under the mistaken "overrides don't work"
diagnosis this phase disproves.

### Phase 254 — Security advisory remediation

**Objective.** Retire the now-dead brace-expansion security exception (phase
253 already patched it), re-justify the three exceptions expiring 2026-08-13
with fresh reachability analysis, and capture ip-address moderate-advisory
evidence — ahead of the 2026-08-12 deadline.

**Files.** `docs/security/audit-exceptions.md`;
`packages/core/tests/docs/security-ci.test.ts`; new `254-01-T2-EVIDENCE.md`.

**As built (2026-08-05).** Both ACs pass. Independent review caught and fixed
an over-deletion (a still-valid whole-doc regression test) and a missing AC-1
coverage token, plus an overstated claim that vitest ≥3.2.6 "closes this
permanently" — PR #235's own commit message showed 3.x still transitively
resolved a vulnerable `vite@5.4.21`; corrected to name ≥4.1.10 as the real
deferred target. PR #374.

### Phase 255 — Make Security and CodeQL merge-blocking (rec-20260804-006)

**Objective.** Add stable `security-success`/`codeql-success` aggregator status
checks (mirroring `ci-success`'s pattern) so a red Security/CodeQL run on `main`
actually blocks merge — `required_status_checks.contexts` was exactly
`["ci-success"]`, so a failing/skipped security or CodeQL job blocked nothing.

**Files.** `.github/workflows/security.yml`, `codeql.yml`;
`packages/core/tests/docs/security-ci.test.ts`;
`docs/security/audit-exceptions.md`.

**As built (2026-08-05).** All 5 ACs pass. Deliberately excludes `sbom` from
`security-success`'s needs (compliance artifact, not a security verdict).
Independent review caught a present-tense overclaim that gates were already
blocking before the operator's post-merge branch-protection step, and a real
bug in the coverage engine's `js-ts` masking profile — a regex literal with an
odd-parity quote sequence desynced the string/comment classifier, silently
mismasking later code; fixed by hex-escaping the quotes, filed as
rec-20260805-004 (masker itself unfixed, out of phase scope). The branch-
protection contexts addition itself is recorded as an explicit, sequenced,
manual, post-merge, operator-only GitHub Settings action — not automated by
this phase. Filed rec-20260805-003 (draft-parser only captures a task's first
action line, silently dropping the multi-line runbook for machine consumers).
PR #376.

### Phase 256 — Real-provider certification prep

**Objective.** Prepare a disposable seeded-defect fixture and a paste-ready
operator runbook so Thomas (not an agent) can personally certify code-review
and security-audit against a real, non-mock provider from a real terminal.
Supplies "settle 1 of 3" toward `dec-20260801-003`'s revisit trigger; explicitly
not reopening rec-20260801-010.

**Files.** `.cadence/phases/256-real-provider-certification-prep/fixture/
{seeded-defect.ts,seeded-defect.fixed.ts}`, `CONDUCTION-RUNBOOK.md` (all three
deliberately deleted before the final commit);
`packages/core/tests/docs/phase256-conduction-prep.test.ts` (also scratch,
deleted alongside).

**256-01 — void, redone as 256-02.** Settled 2026-08-06 with
`assurance.overall: strong`, both gates ran under `provider: host-cli` — but
this was a *false record*: the fixture had already been committed (`9fb2eef6`)
before settle ran, so `security-audit`'s real codex call saw an empty diff and
returned no findings without ever judging the seeded credential; the one
code-review finding was real but incidental (only `CONDUCTION-RUNBOOK.md` had
an actual diff). Recorded void via `dec-20260806-001`; filed rec-20260806-004
(general gap: any diff-scoped verifier gate silently no-ops if its own
artifacts are already committed at settle time — not specific to this phase).
`securityAudit.provider` manually reverted to `mock` immediately after.

**256-02 — redo (commit-timing fix), settled clean 2026-08-06.** Fixed the root
cause: the fixture must never land in a commit (stays staged-but-uncommitted at
every real settle call), enforced by a mandatory pre-flight (`git ls-tree HEAD`
empty → `git add` → `git diff --no-color HEAD` non-empty, in that exact order)
before *every* settle call including the mock dry run. Five refused attempts
preceded the final clean settle, all real, non-mock, host-cli-backed, each
catching a genuine defect in the fixture or test design along the way. Final
`256-02-SUMMARY.json`: 1 MEDIUM finding on the runbook itself (its "stop and
report" branch skipped reverting `securityAudit.provider` to mock) — fixed,
settled clean. As-built amendment: the final test ships a synthetic
string-concatenation sample rather than a literal credential, to validate
detector regexes independent of live disk content. Also corrects the DRAFT's
framing that only the final clean settle counts toward `dec-20260801-003`'s
3-settle trigger — the decision's actual text counts *any* settle persisting
≥1 finding, and all six real settles in this phase qualify. Filed two
engine-facing findings outside `rec-20260806-004`'s scope:
`build-test-must-pass`'s `--allow-failing-build` bypass silently swallows which
test failed, and code-review's convergence-attempt budget persists *across*
separate settle invocations for the same draft, undocumented. PR #377. Tier
`complex`/profile `strict` (DRAFT-level override, no engine changes).

## Backfilled: phases 257–270 (2026-08-11)

Phases 257–270 were built and shipped but never written up here, the same gap
phase 256's backfill closed for 243–256 — `rec-20260727-012`'s anti-recurrence
check (shipped as phase 259, see below) flags this drift but does not write
the prose itself, by design. Phase 269 does not exist: a mis-scoped
`draft new` briefly created it with no real content before the mistake was
caught and its work re-scoped to phase 270; nothing shipped under 269.

### Phase 257 — Render code-review/security-audit findings in Markdown summaries (#379)

**Objective.** Persisted `codeReview`/`securityAudit` findings on `SummaryZ` were never
rendered by the Markdown summary writers, so a refused settle or PR gave no visibility
into the finding that caused the refusal without reading raw JSON. Render both finding
kinds in both renderers, redacted via the existing `redactSecrets` utility, without
changing byte-compatibility for historical summaries lacking findings.

**As built (2026-08-06).** Shipped as designed. PR #379.

### Phase 258 — JS/TS coverage scanner models regex literals in the span mask (#380)

**Objective.** `coverage-profiles/mask.ts`'s `classify()` state machine had no concept of
a JS/TS regex literal, so a raw or escaped paren/quote inside one could desync the
string/comment classifier and silently mismask later code (the same class of bug phase
255 found and fixed for one specific quote sequence).

**As built (2026-08-06).** Shipped as designed. PR #380.

### Phase 259 — `cadence doctor` check: roadmap-currency (rec-20260727-012) (#381)

**Objective.** Add a warning-only, non-blocking `cadence doctor` check comparing the
highest phase number under `.cadence/phases/` against the highest phase number
referenced in `ROADMAP.md`/`MILESTONES.md` (`min` across both files), warning past a
10-phase drift threshold — closing the gap that caused the 113-phase/6-week drift fixed
in PR #321. `fixId` deliberately stays `null`: generating roadmap prose must never be
automated. Originally scoped as phase 231; shipped as 259 since 231 had long since been
claimed by unrelated work by the time this DRAFT was written.

**As built (2026-08-07).** Shipped as designed, all 5 ACs pass —
`checkRoadmapCurrency`/`ROADMAP_DRIFT_WARN_THRESHOLD = 10` in
`packages/core/src/doctor/run.ts`. This is the check phase 271 (below) is closing the
warning on. PR #381.

### Phase 260 — Vitest 2 → 4 major upgrade, close deferred audit exceptions (#382)

**Objective.** Upgrade vitest `2.1.9` → `^4.1.10` (the proven-sufficient floor per
`docs/security/audit-exceptions.md`, not the `>=3.2.6` advisory floor) across root + all
6 `packages/*` workspaces + `website`, fixing the two known Vitest-4 breakages, closing 3
deferred audit exceptions, and superseding dependabot PRs #370/#244.

**As built (2026-08-07).** Shipped as designed. PR #382.

### Phase 261 — Historical AC-coverage audit for pre-phase-239 records (#385)

**Objective.** Answer `rec-20260729-006`'s question with real data: of the 255
pre-phase-239 settled `SUMMARY.json` records (written before the phase-qualified
coverage-token scheme existed), how many would actually change verdict if replayed under
the new scheme versus the old bare-token one — a read-only, reproducible audit, no
behavior change.

**As built (2026-08-08).** Shipped as designed. PR #385.

### Phase 262 — `cadence doctor` check: release-currency (#386)

**Objective.** Add a warning-only `cadence doctor` check, `release-currency`, detecting
when the local repo's published-package content has drifted from what's actually
published to npm (unreleased changesets, engine-floor mismatches) — the release-side
counterpart to phase 259's roadmap-currency check.

**As built (2026-08-08).** Shipped as designed. PR #386.

### Phase 263 — Provider selection provenance: configured vs fallback vs empty-diff (#388)

**Objective.** Persisted gate provenance couldn't distinguish a deliberately-configured
provider from one that silently fell back to mock, nor from a real provider whose call
structurally couldn't judge anything because its diff was empty — three epistemically
distinct states that looked identical or went unrecorded. Adds a `providerSelection`
field populated at the single shared code path that already knows each answer, across
all seven verifier seams, without changing any provider identity string, the schema
version, or any gate's pass/fail/refuse behavior.

**As built (2026-08-08).** Shipped as designed. PR #388.

### Phase 264 — Rendered label precision for verifier provenance (#389)

**Objective.** Make the rendered provider label for `mock` precise and honest at the
display layer — `cadence summary render`, the SUMMARY.md sidecar, `cadence doctor`,
`cadence config explain`, and the phase-243 fallback banners — surfacing whether a mock
result was a deliberately configured choice or an unannounced fallback (phase 263's
`providerSelection`), through one single-sourced formatting function, without touching
the mock provider identity or the JSON schema.

**As built (2026-08-09).** Shipped as designed. PR #389.

### Phase 265 — Affirmative provider selection at `cadence init` (#391)

**Objective.** Make `cadence init` present the verifier provider choice explicitly and
record it as a retrievable intelligence-ledger decision, so no repo can run indefinitely
under an inherited default without the operator having made or seen that choice —
without requiring a real provider (`dec-20260808-002`) or breaking any non-interactive
init path.

**As built (2026-08-09).** Shipped as designed. PR #391.

### Phase 266 — Root-cause two confirmed Windows CI timeouts (#392)

**Objective.** Root-cause two worsening Windows CI timeout failures
(`summary-verify-sweep` spawning one CLI subprocess per historical `SUMMARY.json`, 275+
and growing; the skill-invoke FIFO-cap test's 105 serial real-disk dispatcher
round-trips) rather than raising timeouts — both had materialized together on PR #391's
Windows leg and independently on 3 of the last 5 push-to-main CI runs. Bundled into one
phase per `dec-20260809-001`.

**As built (2026-08-09).** Shipped as designed. PR #392.

### Phase 267 — Mock abstains on review-family gates instead of recording a pass (#393)

**Objective.** Make it structurally impossible for the mock verifier to record a
review-gate pass: `code-review`, `security-audit`, `plan-review`, `spec-review`, and
`ui-spec-review` abstain (`status: skipped` + `skipReason`) under a mock provider instead
of passing, decided at the gate/registry layer before the verifier is ever dispatched.
`deep-verify`/`per-task-verify` keep their existing mock-pass semantics. Once abstention
shipped, the repo's own gate profile moved off `auto` to an explicitly approved value
(`standard`), closing `dec-20260804-001`'s deferred baseline-profile decision.

**As built (2026-08-10).** Shipped as designed, across three fix rounds (`dec-20260809-004`,
`dec-20260809-005`, `dec-20260810-002`, `dec-20260810-003`) correcting the abstention
mechanism's exact recording site. PR #393.

### Phase 268 — Conduction drift counter for `cadence doctor`/`status` (#394)

**Objective.** `conduction-reachability` (phase 251) answers a point-in-time capability
question ("can this repo conduct a real finding") but nothing answered the trend
question ("has it, lately") — exactly how 263 settles accumulated under mock with zero
escalation before the v1.54 audit caught it. Derive a read-only streak counter from the
SUMMARY corpus (consecutive settles with no non-mock verifier identity in provenance),
surface it in `cadence doctor`/`status`, and escalate severity by streak length.

**As built (2026-08-10).** Shipped as designed. PR #394.

### Phase 270 — Fix demo-test-gutting coverage-scheme regression (rec-20260810-001) (#396)

**Objective.** `examples/demo-test-gutting/run-demo.sh`'s post-init config patch never
set `verification.coverageScheme`, so it inherited phase 239's fresh-init default
(`'phase-qualified'`) while its fixtures use bare `AC-N` tokens — every AC showed "has no
linked test" at both the buggy-code and redemption steps, masking the demo's actual
thesis (an assertion-mode gutted test caught by the coverage gate). Set
`coverageScheme:'bare'` in the script's post-init patch, mirroring
`packages/core/src/tutorial/fixtures.ts:47`'s existing immunization for the same reason.

**As built (2026-08-10).** Shipped as designed. New end-to-end test
(`packages/core/tests/integration/demo-gutting-coverage-scheme.test.ts`) spawns the real
script; caught a real CI-only bug during review (the test relied on ambient git
identity, absent on CI runners) fixed with an explicit `GIT_AUTHOR_*`/`GIT_COMMITTER_*`
env before merge. PR #396.

### Phase 271 — Pre-release record integrity: roadmap/milestone currency (#397)

**Objective.** Close the roadmap-currency doctor warning and the milestone-status
desync so main's own planning records are honest before v1.56.0 cuts, per
`docs/handoffs/HANDOFF-v1.56-release-closeout.md`'s Phase Q.

**As built (2026-08-10).** Shipped as designed. PR #397.

### Phase 272 — `assurance-record.ts` correctness pass (#399)

**Objective.** Fix a raw NUL byte in `assurance-record.ts` that made the file
grep-classify as binary, add a regression guard against recurrence, resolve the
`deriveAssuranceRecord` weak-classification docstring/code mismatch, and record a
decision on rec-20260808-007's deep-verify/per-task-verify provenance exclusion —
an encoding and correctness pass, not a schema or behavior change.

**As built (2026-08-11).** Shipped as designed. PR #399.

### Phase 273 — Resume warns on dangling `lastHandoff` pointer (#403)

**Objective.** `locateFreshestHandoff` silently fell back to a freshest-by-
`generated_at` glob whenever `state.json`'s `session.lastHandoff` named a
`SESSION-*.md` file that no longer existed, with zero signal to the caller that
the pointer was dangling. Investigated rec-20260811-009's claim that the
fallback picks lexicographically-last rather than most-recent and found it did
not match the code — the real defect was the missing signal, not the ranking.
Added a warning surfaced when resume serves a fallback doc instead of the
pointer's actual target.

**As built (2026-08-11).** Shipped with one scope amendment: AC-3 ("full test
suite passes") was removed post-BUILD as an unencodable, command-output-shaped
process claim — no test assertion can prove "the suite exits 0" without being
either circular or a comment-only mention. PR #403.

### Phase 274 — Unobservable-criteria classification for deep-verify honesty (#405)

**Objective.** Added a settle-time classifier recognizing when an AC's
satisfaction condition falls outside deep-verify's observable surface
(`{acs, tests, diff, files}`) — most commonly because the AC's Then-clause makes
`SUMMARY.md`/`SUMMARY.json` content itself the verification target, which is
circular since that artifact does not exist until after the very settle that
would check it. Wired into deep-verify's offender/refusal path and the
force-used honesty report as a new `unobservable` verdict state (D-G,
`dec-20260812-004`, superseding `dec-20260812-001`) that is reported but never
rolls up as `pass` and never blocks settle on its own.

**As built (2026-08-12).** Shipped across six independently-found amendments
during build/review: a real coverage-scanner dedup bug that hid same-file,
same-AC-token assertions from deep-verify (filed as `rec-20260812-004`), a
too-narrow negation-detection span that risked a false `unobservable`
verdict, and several DRAFT `files:`-line precision fixes needed for
deep-verify's diff to actually see this phase's own new test files. PR #405.

### Phase 275 — Deep-verify/per-task-verify provider provenance excluded from assurance rollup (#407)

**Objective.** Closed rec-20260808-007's provenance gap (v1.57's Phase V):
`deep-verify` and `per-task-verify` persisted no verifier-provider identity into
`SummaryZ.gates[]` at all, unlike `code-review`/`security-audit`. Added a
structurally separate `observedProvider`/`observedModel`/`taskId` field set to
`GateProvenanceZ`, distinct from the existing `provider`/`model` fields, so
per-task verifier identity is recorded without feeding into the assurance
rollup.

**As built (2026-08-13).** Shipped as designed. PR #407.

### Phase 276 — Pre-phase-102 recommendation archive backfill (#418)

**Objective.** Backfilled the pre-phase-102 recommendations that already
carried terminal status into the archived bucket via the existing CLI (zero new
code), and recorded the archiveReason-fidelity decision for the backfill.

**As built (2026-08-13).** Archived 21 of the 22 candidates. The 22nd
(`rec-20260701-001`) had `status: converted` but no `shippedRef` — it was
never actually promoted to `shipped` after conversion, unlike the other 21,
so it was correctly excluded from this backfill and left as-is. PR #418.

### Phase 277 — `cadence doctor` check: recommendation-archive-currency (#419)

**Objective.** Added a deterministic, warning-only `cadence doctor` check that
no recommendation in the active ledger array carries a terminal
`shipped`/`rejected` status without being archived — the invariant phase 276's
backfill restored — following the `roadmap-currency`/`release-currency` house
pattern.

**As built (2026-08-13).** Shipped as designed, with AC-3's wording corrected
during implementation (a missing `recommendations.json` legitimately falls
through to the zero-offenders `ok` path, not `indeterminate`, matching
`checkConductionDriftStreak`'s own precedent) and one regression test added
by the whole-branch review before merge. PR #419.

### Phase 278 — `cadence demo` + progressive-disclosure onboarding stages (#421)

**Objective.** Shipped a non-interactive `cadence demo` refuse-then-succeed
command reachable from a bare `npx` invocation, plus a minimal
progressive-disclosure onboarding-stage system gating `cadence help`/`start`
visibility, while keeping `cadence tutorial` working via a redirect notice.

**As built (2026-08-14).** Shipped as designed. PR #421.

### Phase 279 — Dispatch policy engine (#428)

**Objective.** Gave `config.subagentPolicy` and `config.modelPerClass` — fully
schema'd, defaulted, and live in `.cadence/config.json`, but with zero
consumers anywhere in `packages/core/src` — their first reader: a pure
classifier computing `{ execution, modelClass, model, reasons[] }` per task,
threaded read-only/advisory through `cadence dispatch plan`'s JSON output and
the dispatch packet.

**As built (2026-08-14).** Shipped as designed. PR #428.

### Phase 280 — Dispatch contract: record-time boundary/redundancy enforcement (#429)

**Objective.** Made the dispatch contract enforceable at the moment a task
outcome is recorded, closing rec-20260718-003/-004/-005: stop-conditions as a
machine-readable DRAFT field, boundary+redundancy checks with a real block path
at record time (not just settle), and side-channel documentation for the
AskUserQuestion gap.

**As built (2026-08-15).** Shipped as designed. PR #429.

### Phase 281 — Close the `cadence done` bypass hole (rec-20260815-002)

**Objective.** `cadence done <id>` is documented as a shortcut for `cadence build
task <id> --status=DONE` but called `recordTaskOutcome` directly, bypassing
three gates `build task` runs via `buildTaskService`: the per-task-verify
gate, the record-time boundary/redundancy check (phase 280), and the
pre-existing unknown-task-id guard (Phase 29.8; carried into `buildTaskService`
by phase 58's MCP-surface extraction). Route `done` through
`buildTaskService` so it is a true alias carrying identical guarantees, per
decision `dec-20260815-005` (D-N). The gap predates v1.60.0's dispatch-contract
release (per-task-verify was already unguarded before phase 280; phase 280
layered the boundary/redundancy gap on top) — v1.60.0 shipped before this fix
landed, so the gap is present in a released version pending the next release.

### Phase 282 — Coverage scanner dedup ordering + walk-order determinism (#435)

**Objective.** Made the coverage scanner (`packages/core/src/verify/coverage.ts`)
return the same answer for the same input every time, fixed the per-file dedup
so a qualifying occurrence is never shadowed by an earlier non-qualifying one,
and made `verify coverage --explain` agree with the gate it explains.

**As built (2026-08-16).** Shipped as designed. Independent review later found
two host-cli deep-verify verdicts (AC-2, AC-4) had come back `pass:false` and
were `--force`-overridden; see phase 284's reconciliation. PR #435.

### Phase 283 — Bypass-aware assurance grading (#437)

**Objective.** A settle whose gates were bypassed, or whose real verifier
failed ACs that `--force` overrode, must not be gradable as
`assurance.overall: 'strong'` — `deriveAssuranceRecord` previously read
`acResults` only, which by settle time already recorded `pass:true` for a
`--force`-overridden AC, making a forced settle over real failures
indistinguishable from a clean one (measured against phases 272 and 282, both
of which had graded `'strong'` over recorded `gateBypasses` and real host-cli
`deepVerify` failures).

**As built (2026-08-16).** Shipped as designed. PR #437.

### Phase 284 — Reconcile phase 282's AC-2/AC-4 verifier record (#444)

**Objective.** Reconciled phase 282's historical record: two host-cli
deep-verify verdicts (AC-2, AC-4) had come back `pass:false` and were
overridden with `--force`, but 282's own As-built amendment blocks showed
independent reviewers had already found and corrected both underlying issues
in ways the verifier's judgement didn't reflect. Determined from the artifacts
that both were substantively delivered, amended the record accordingly (never
rewriting `282-01-SUMMARY.json` directly), and filed the systemic
amendment-vs-verifier gap this revealed — a legitimately amended AC has no path
back to deep-verify — as a recommendation.

**As built (2026-08-20).** Shipped as designed. PR #444.

### Phase 285 — `verify coverage --explain` no longer double-qualifies an already-qualified AC id (rec-20260816-001) (#450)

**Objective.** Under `verification.coverageScheme: 'phase-qualified'`, passing
an already-qualified `--explain` argument (e.g. `282-01/AC-4`) previously
caused the active draft's qualifier to be prepended a second time, producing a
search token that could never match, silently and at exit 0. Per D-X
(`rec-20260816-001`), normalized an already-qualified argument to its bare form
with a stderr notice, matching the existing Quiet Fallback precedent in the
same function.

**As built (2026-08-20).** Shipped as designed. Whole-branch review found the
opposite-direction failure too: a naive unconditional strip down to an empty
string produced a false SATISFIED at exit 0 via an empty-pattern match — worse
than the bug this phase set out to fix. The shipped fix refuses that case
outright rather than searching it. PR #450.

### Phase 286 — Glob-expand boundary `files:` patterns (rec-20260815-005) (#453)

**Objective.** A `files:` entry containing a wildcard must match the files it
describes, in both `warn` and `block` mode. `runBoundaryCheck`
(`packages/core/src/checks/boundary.ts`) compared `declaredFiles` to
`touchedFiles` via exact `Set` membership — no glob library existed in
`packages/core`'s dependencies — so a wildcard boundary entry was silently
unmatchable. Added glob expansion to the boundary check.

**As built (2026-08-21).** Shipped after four real (non-mock) deep-verify
refusal rounds during settle, each closed by strengthening evidence rather
than arguing with the verifier: real negative-case/broadened-snapshot tests,
a byte-identity re-derivation via a scoped `git stash` round-trip to prove
pre/post-change snapshots, an in-place AC-2 amendment from a
procedure-shaped claim to an invariant-shaped one (`dec-20260821-002`,
snapshot files replaced by explicit `toEqual()`), and a direct structural
test for AC-5's zero-match isolation. Full suite re-verified clean after each
round. PR #453.

### Phase 287 — Assurance grade excludes empty-diff-only gates from earning strong (#457)

**Objective.** Fixed `deriveAssuranceRecord` so a settle whose only non-mock
verifier signal is `providerSelection: 'empty-diff'` — a provider call that
structurally could not judge anything because its diff was empty — cannot earn
`assurance.overall: 'strong'` alone, while a settle with a genuinely-configured
non-mock gate present alongside an empty-diff one still can. Closed the gap
between phase 263 (gates learned to tag empty-diff) and phase 283 (the grade
learned to read bypasses) that
`docs/handoffs/HANDOFF-verifier-honesty-verify-premises.md` identified.

**As built (2026-08-21).** Shipped as designed. PR #457.

### Phase 288 — Zero-AC drafts fail loud instead of passing every gate vacuously (#460)

**Objective.** A DRAFT whose `## Acceptance Criteria` section is non-empty but
yields zero parsed `### AC-N` blocks (e.g. a non-numeric heading like
`### AC-K1:`) previously parsed silently to an empty AC array that
structural-verifier, test-coverage, evidence-floor, and other gates all
vacuously passed. Made that case fail loud instead.

**As built (2026-08-21).** Shipped as designed. PR #460.

### Phase 289 — Dispatch write authority: `CADENCE_READ_ONLY` structurally enforced at the store's write layer (rec-20260822-003, rec-20260822-004) (#463)

**Objective.** A sub-agent instructed to be read-only must be structurally
unable to mutate the intelligence ledger. Enforced a `CADENCE_READ_ONLY`
env-gated refusal at the intelligence store's write entry points (D-AH), left
the three read-only investigation commands (`context`, `recommend`, `inspect`)
and `recommendation list`/`next` untouched (D-AI), documented the
`settings.json` env-scoping mechanism's add/update-live-but-delete-sticky
quirk (D-AJ), and updated the dispatch packet's prose to claim only what's
actually enforced (D-AK).

**As built (2026-08-22).** Shipped as designed. PR #463.

### Phase 290 — Packs slice 1: manifest resolve and validate, zero behavioral effect (#467)

**Objective.** Added a `PackManifest` schema, a `resolvePacks()` resolver, and
a `cadence doctor` check reporting whether each enabled pack resolves — with
zero behavioral effect on gate computation. Proves I-1/I-2/I-4a from
`docs/packs-design.md` without touching `gatesFor`/`effectiveGateSet`'s output
for any existing fixture.

**As built (2026-08-22).** Shipped as designed. PR #467.

### Phase 291 — Packs slice 2: `skillAudit.required` contribution with provenance (rec-20260822-010) (#468)

**Objective.** Made a pack's `skillAudit.required` a real, behavioral
contributor to `runSkillAuditCheck`'s `effectiveRequired` set, with
per-requirement provenance (`config`/`draft`/`pack:<id>`) recorded in
`SUMMARY.json` (D-AS). First slice where a resolved pack does anything — so
`cadence doctor`'s `packs` check also escalated from warning to a hard
settle-time refusal for an enabled-but-unresolvable pack, per
`dec-20260822-025`'s two-phase D-AR plan reaching phase two.

**As built (2026-08-22).** Shipped as designed. PR #468.

### Phase 292 — Packs slice 3: tighten-only gate-profile deltas via `effectiveGateSet` (rec-20260822-011) *(in progress)*

**Objective.** Make a pack's declared `gates[].add` deltas actually enforce:
union pack-contributed gates into `effectiveGateSet()`'s output at every real
call site (not just resolve them), reflect enabled packs' contribution in
`cadence config explain`'s current-tier row while the tier×profile matrix
table stays raw, and regression-test that a non-additive manifest shape is
rejected at parse time — completing Packs Slice 3 per `docs/packs-design.md`
§4b/§7 and rec-20260822-011.

### Phase 303 — Changeset-existence coverage tests survive release consumption (rec-20260916-002) *(in progress)*

**Objective.** Phase 300's and phase 301's coverage-token tests each satisfied
their meta-AC (under `coverageMode: assertion` + `coverageScheme:
phase-qualified`) with a bare `existsSync('.changeset/<name>.md')` assertion —
a release's `changeset version` step deletes consumed changeset files, so the
very next release would have permanently redded both tests. Extracts a shared,
pure `changesetEvidencePresent` helper (`packages/core/tests/support/
changeset-evidence.ts`) that passes when either the changeset file still names
the package, or — post-consumption — `packages/core/CHANGELOG.md` contains a
discriminator string pinned per fix and verified (by live grep during
drafting) to have zero pre-existing hits, so the fallback stays meaningful
rather than hollow.

### Phase 237 — Invariant promotion from recurring findings *(sketch — contingent)*

**Gate to entry.** Phase 236 settled and has produced enough routed findings for
`RetroRollup.findingCategories.recurring` to be non-trivially populated. This is
`needs-evidence` by design — entering early means promoting invariants from noise.

**Objective (sketch).** Consume the already-built
`RetroRollup.findingCategories.recurring` (phase 186) and split **recurring-unanchored** (an
invariant candidate — something that keeps going wrong that no criterion names) from
**recurring-anchored** (a spec-quality signal — criteria that keep being violated). Maps to
rec-20260727-008 (low, `needs-evidence`).

### Not yet phases

- **rec-20260727-007** — shared fingerprint primitive extraction from Déjà
  (`needs-evidence`). A prerequisite *investigation* for phase 236's finding identity, not a
  phase of its own. Resolve before 236 is drafted.
  **Resolved 2026-07-30 — rejected** (`dec-20260730-001`, evidence `ev-20260730-001`).
  Déjà is not consumable as a library (`main`/`exports` both null, unpublished under a name
  Cadence could depend on); its normalization layer carries tree-sitter and its matching
  layer carries better-sqlite3, both native, against core's zero-runtime-dependency bias;
  and the problems differ in shape — Déjà solves *retrieval* over an indexed corpus, Cadence
  needs *identity* across two small per-run sets. Reopen only if `undeclared`-tier findings
  become a material share of routed ledger entries **and** identity churn across refactors
  is measured rather than assumed.
- **rec-20260727-009** — counter-verifier as a kernel component (`raw-idea`).
- **rec-20260727-010** — Conductor as a CLI client (`raw-idea`).

Both `raw-idea` items are architectural raw material. They are recorded here so the arc's
shape is legible, and are deliberately **not** given phase numbers.
