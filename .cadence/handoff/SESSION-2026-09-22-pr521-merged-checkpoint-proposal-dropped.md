# Session Handoff — 2026-09-22 (pr521-merged-checkpoint-proposal-dropped)

## TL;DR for the next session
- **This was a short session**: checked whether PR #521 (the 2026-09-18 PC-transfer handoff) had merged, merged it on request, and discovered `main` had moved a lot since — the "PC transfer" worked. Another session on another machine picked up `rec-20260918-003` (the exact bug I flagged) and shipped it as **phase 314** (`d972b0af`, #524), plus a ROADMAP/MILESTONES backfill (#523) and ledger reconciliation (#522).
- **`main` is now at `225d9012`**, fully caught up. Loop is IDLE, no active draft.
- **There is an open, unmerged, unreviewed PR sitting since 2026-09-18: #526** ("file phase-315 scoping decisions and the identity-half split", branch `chore/phase-315-ledger-filing`) — filed by the other session, never landed. Nobody has looked at it since. This is the single biggest loose end.
- **A new, uncommitted operator-authored planning doc appeared**: `docs/handoffs/HANDOFF-checkpoint-handoff-before-reset.md` — a substantial proposal for a "handoff-before-reset checkpoint" system (replacing lossy `/compact` with a gated, validated handoff-and-resume cycle). It authorizes Phase 0 (investigation) and Phase 1 (validator) only; Phases 2-6 are described but explicitly need operator go-ahead. **Not started, not committed, not evaluated this session** — just discovered and read for context.
- **Three stray remote branches** left over from the other PC's session, all already merged and safe to delete: `worktree-314-hook-shim-cwd-passthrough`, `worktree-roadmap-backfill-314`, and the older `docs/session-handoff-2026-09-18` (local+remote, pre-dates even the 2026-09-18 session, orphaned).
- **Still present, still unresolved**: the untracked `docs/handoffs/McAfee_Installer_...exe` file first flagged 2026-09-18. Still there, still untouched.

## CADENCE context   ·  pre-filled from `cadence context handoff`
- Top recommendations:
  - rec-20260907-002 — packages/core/tsconfig.json includes only src/**/*, so no repo command ever typechecks tests/ (candidate/ready-for-cadence-spec)
  - rec-20260917-008 — docs/reference/config.md overclaims skill-audit: says it enforces skills were invoked 'during a phase', which the checkout-scoped invoked list does not support (candidate/ready-for-cadence-spec)
  - rec-20260918-005 — DRAFT.md with UTF-8 BOM (+ optionally CRLF) still throws the misleading 'missing frontmatter' error (candidate/ready-for-cadence-spec)
  - rec-20260918-006 — draft-mutate.ts's add-ac/add-task splice regexes are \n-only, so a CRLF draft now fails with a different misleading error post-phase-310 (candidate/ready-for-cadence-spec)
  - rec-20260918-007 — spec-parser.ts and ui-spec-parser.ts have the identical CRLF frontmatter-rejection bug phase 310 fixed for draft-parser.ts (candidate/ready-for-cadence-spec)
- Open assumptions:
  - (none)
- Active decisions:
  - dec-20260711-001 — Multi-language assertion-coverage: fast diagnose-fix now, shared-lexer engine as a later phase
  - dec-20260721-001 — cadence next extends nextAction(), does not subsume quickstart or reimplement
  - dec-20260721-002 — Shared legal-moves computation also powers empty-state footers (rec-20260721-001)
  - dec-20260721-003 — cadence next --json includes schemaVersion: 1
  - dec-20260721-004 — Ship /cadence-next slash command alongside the CLI command
  - dec-20260724-001 — Enforce ledger-diff at audit close, not a standing rule
  - dec-20260724-002 — Scope rec-20260724-003 to a CHANGELOG-currency gate only, defer auto-generation
  - dec-20260726-001 — Split SUMMARY.json attestation: content-hash now, full signing deferred to threat model
  - dec-20260730-001 — Coverage phase-scoping uses a phase-qualified test token, not file-ownership scoping
  - dec-20260728-001 — Phase 233 AC-3 tripwire cleared: assurance-record derivation is gate-agnostic
  - dec-20260729-001 — Phase 234 AC-1 narrowed: contracts/ is the type-naming surface, not the resolution surface
  - dec-20260729-002 — Uniform opts? on VerifierPort is what makes zero-special-cases true
  - dec-20260729-003 — Phase 235 scope: criteria-anchoring is code-review only, not spec-review/ui-spec-review/plan-review
  - dec-20260729-004 — Anchor executable tier: non-empty verify + build-test-must-pass ran, no prose heuristic
  - dec-20260729-005 — Criteria-gap refusal reuses code-review's existing HIGH-severity refuse path, not gates.evidenceFloor
  - dec-20260729-006 — D3 unconditional declaration binds the floor outcome, not the empty-gap case
  - dec-20260731-001 — Findings-to-ledger routing merges same-identity findings by design; the identity hash itself is not changed
  - dec-20260801-001 — Add a settle-time guard for global-CLI-shadowing-branch-build; interim rule is settle via the local build
  - dec-20260801-002 — Finding identity narrowed to (file, normalized message); anchor/severity dropped as identity inputs
  - dec-20260801-003 — Defer finding-identity message-drift dedup: wait for real-provider data, offline analyzer first
  - dec-20260802-001 — Refused gate-loop settles thread acc's findings into the SUMMARY, with a conditional contentHash
  - dec-20260802-002 — Attempt preservation via timestamp-slugged sibling artifact, invisible to all current SUMMARY consumers by construction
  - dec-20260802-003 — Ledger routing stays finalize-only on refusal; Slice 3's revisit trigger amended to name its precondition
  - dec-20260803-001 — Conduction stays operator-initiated: guard and gate set retained; mock-provider default is a separate ordinary config decision
  - dec-20260804-001 — Defer baseline profile change to v1.56 Phase P
  - dec-20260806-001 — 256-01's assurance:strong record is void -- empty-diff false pass, not a real certification result
  - dec-20260808-001 — D-A: Do not rename the mock provider identity
  - dec-20260808-002 — D-B: Do not require a real verifier provider at cadence init
  - dec-20260808-003 — v1.56 Phase O sequenced after Phase P, not before (amends HANDOFF-v1.56 §5 priority table)
  - dec-20260808-004 — J.1 (overall: strong structurally unreachable) resolved for the profile-override path; still true for the default auto-profile path
  - dec-20260808-005 — Phase L's providerSelection field widens to a third state covering empty-diff false-pass, not just configured/fallback
  - dec-20260808-007 — providerSelection field: optional enum, no default, no schemaVersion bump (corrected citation)
  - dec-20260808-008 — Phase 263 (v1.56 Phase L): narrow providerSelection persistence to 5 seams, exclude deep-verify/per-task-verify
  - dec-20260808-009 — Phase M: render-time join over AssuranceRecordZ schema change for providerSelection
  - dec-20260808-010 — Phase M: umbrella mock-capability label, not per-verifier-family variants
  - dec-20260809-001 — Bundle rec-20260806-010 + rec-20260809-002 into one CI-timeout-remediation phase
  - dec-20260809-002 — Phase P (267): mock abstains on review gates rather than passing them
  - dec-20260809-004 — Phase 267 (P.1, corrected): mock abstention is identity-at-recording, not no-dispatch
  - dec-20260809-005 — Phase 267 (P.1, mechanism correction): plan-review/spec-review/ui-spec-review abstain via converge.ts's shared sidecar, not registry.ts
  - dec-20260810-001 — Phase 267 (T6): repo profile flipped auto -> standard, closing dec-20260804-001's revisit trigger
  - dec-20260810-002 — Phase 267 (fix round): converge.ts sidecar persists verdict:'abstained'+pass:false/converged:false for mockAbstained entries, not pass:true+sibling flag
  - dec-20260810-003 — Phase 267 (fix round 3): code-review.ts's own CODE-REVIEW.json sidecar also abstains under mock, independent of registry.ts's SUMMARY-level relabel
  - dec-20260810-004 — Phase O (268): build the drift counter now, defer O.3's measured threshold
  - dec-20260810-005 — Phase O (268): add an indeterminate rung to DoctorSeverity, resolving v1.55 J.2
  - dec-20260811-001 — D-E: security-audit stays unreachable through v1.56 (option 2, matrix change, deferred to v1.57)
  - dec-20260811-002 — Reaffirm deep-verify/per-task-verify provenance exclusion through v1.56.0, defer to v1.57
  - dec-20260812-002 — D-H: 'unobservable' evidence class sits off-ladder, orthogonal to AcEvidenceZ
  - dec-20260812-003 — D-I: reaffirm security-audit deferral at profile=standard, do not reopen the DELTAS matrix in v1.57
  - dec-20260812-004 — D-G (corrected measurement): unobservable-AC criteria get a new settle-time verdict class, DRAFT-time refusal deferred to v1.58
  - dec-20260813-001 — W.0: rec-20260812-004 is a duplicate of rec-20260809-001 -- reconciled into the earlier filing
  - dec-20260813-002 — Phase U (v1.57 arc): skipped -- D-I already reaffirmed security-audit deferral
  - dec-20260813-003 — W.2: reaffirm dec-20260810-004's deferral of O.3's measured threshold -- corrected real-data measurement recorded, no new number invented
  - dec-20260813-004 — W.3: reaffirm documented-blocker posture -- no CLI path exists to close a milestone whose sole rec shipped out-of-band; building one is out of scope for a decisions-only phase
  - dec-20260814-001 — D-M: accept archiveReason=manual for the pre-phase-102 archive backfill
  - dec-20260815-001 — D-DQ1: Task execution class -- declared field wins, heuristic cross-checks via coherence warn
  - dec-20260815-002 — D-DQ2: boundaryEnforcement escalates to block, dispatch-scoped, once DP-B lands
  - dec-20260815-003 — D-DQ3: contextBudgetThreshold stays inert this arc -- tokenUtilization is a fake signal
  - dec-20260815-004 — D-DQ4: stop-condition coherence severity is warn, not a blocker, for now
  - dec-20260815-005 — D-N: cadence done becomes a true alias for build task --status=DONE
  - dec-20260815-006 — D-N2: done inherits buildTaskService's unknown-task-id guard too, a third pre-existing gate
  - dec-20260815-007 — D-N3: buildTaskService gains an additive optional anomalySource param for the LoopViolation tag
  - dec-20260816-001 — Fix demo-gutting-coverage-scheme.test.ts flake via per-test timeout, not global bump
  - dec-20260816-002 — D-P amendment: four coverage-dedup filings exist, not three; primary chosen on decision-carrying not chronology
  - dec-20260816-003 — D-O: fix coverage dedup via prefer-qualifying (option 1), not drop-dedup or align-explain-down
  - dec-20260816-004 — Phase D folds into Phase C itself, not a future phase
  - dec-20260816-005 — D-R: bypass/deepVerify honesty enters via a new third argument to deriveAssuranceRecord, acResults untouched
  - dec-20260816-006 — D-S: cap overall at mixed on error-severity bypass, no AssuranceRecordZ schema change
  - dec-20260816-007 — D-T: dec-20260728-001's gate-agnostic invariant is honored, not relitigated
  - dec-20260816-008 — D-U: report-only, no backfill of historical SUMMARY.json grades
  - dec-20260820-001 — D-V: 282-01/AC-2 amended -- pre-fix repro proven impossible
  - dec-20260820-002 — D-V: 282-01/AC-4 split verdict -- runs-summary-verify-all strengthened, phase-id-enumeration already satisfied
  - dec-20260820-003 — D-W: amendment-vs-verifier gap filed as recommendation only (file-only)
  - dec-20260820-004 — Normalize an already-qualified --explain arg, don't reject it
  - dec-20260821-001 — D-Y: boundary files: glob expansion -- full vocabulary, wildcard-only zero-match detection, warn-only, isolated from refusal paths
  - dec-20260821-002 — 286-01/AC-2 amended -- pre-change temporal capture proven unverifiable by a static-tree-reading verifier, not just hard
  - dec-20260821-003 — rec-20260821-003 is a duplicate of rec-20260821-002 -- reconciled into the earlier, richer filing
  - dec-20260821-004 — D-Z: rec-20260807-005 premise corrected -- fresh init already defaults to phase-qualified since phase 239
  - dec-20260822-001 — rec-20260731-003 is shipped: top-level provider field (phase 232) + fallback distinction (phase 263) both landed; remaining deep-verify sliver already answered by dec-20260808-008
  - dec-20260822-003 — D-Z: hasRealVerifier excludes empty-diff-only non-mock gates from earning strong (option 1 of HANDOFF-verifier-honesty-verify-premises.md D-Z)
  - dec-20260822-004 — rec-20260813-002's deep-verify fallback-visibility ask is already answered by dec-20260808-008, not a live gap
  - dec-20260822-005 — AC-J1/AC-J2 amendment: 're-scope rec summary' executed via evidence+decision+promote, not literal summary-text edit
  - dec-20260822-006 — D-AB: no backfill of historical SUMMARY.json records for the empty-diff assurance-grade fix
  - dec-20260822-007 — Reconciliation: dec-20260822-002 was an unauthorized write by a fork agent, not a rival human session
  - dec-20260822-008 — Correction: empty-diff is easily reachable, not merely 'latent' -- 298-record corpus count still stands for D-AB
  - dec-20260822-009 — Correction to dec-20260822-008: 283-01/AC-2's settle.test.ts assertion was NOT invariant to the fix -- 283-02/AC-1 was
  - dec-20260822-010 — D-AD: zero-AC drafts refuse at approve+settle, not a schema minimum
  - dec-20260822-011 — D-AE: non-numeric AC headings reject loudly, AC_TOKEN_RE stays numeric-only
  - dec-20260822-012 — D-AF: dispatch write authority -- env-var read-only mode is viable, env DOES propagate to dispatched sub-agents
  - dec-20260822-013 — D-AL: reject rec-20260822-006 -- writeLedger is guarded, full intelligence/** writer audit found zero bypass
  - dec-20260822-014 — D-AM: file the routing-reconciliation gap, not a staleness-of-review-finding claim
  - dec-20260822-015 — D-AN: item-2 evidence via reconstruction (option 3), not a repeat live deep-verify run or a schema change
  - dec-20260822-016 — D-AO: item 2 does not block the packs arc
  - dec-20260822-017 — Packs I-1: namespaced id grammar <scope>/<name>, internal packs use 'cadence' scope
  - dec-20260822-018 — Packs I-2: manifest carries id/version/integrity from day one; integrity optional for source=local
  - dec-20260822-019 — Packs I-3: gate deltas are tighten-only, enforced for internal packs too, structurally and behaviorally
  - dec-20260822-020 — Packs I-4: resolution via resolvePacks() (impure shell), application via effectiveGateSet() -- both single chokepoints
  - dec-20260822-021 — Packs I-5: precedence is trivial by construction -- union of a monotonic-only payload can't conflict
  - dec-20260822-022 — Packs I-6: packs declare skills by name only, never ship skill bodies through CADENCE
  - dec-20260822-023 — Packs D-AP: payload allowlist = skillAudit.required + gates[].add + declared commands (doctor-checked only)
  - dec-20260822-024 — Packs D-AQ: no pack dependencies in v1; on enabled/disabled id collision, disabled wins
  - dec-20260822-025 — Packs D-AR: discovery via .cadence/packs/<id>/pack.json (filesystem-local, git-tracked); doctor warns now, refuses once behaviorally consumed
  - dec-20260822-026 — Packs D-AS: skillAudit provenance recorded per-requirement (config/draft/pack:<id>), not flattened
  - dec-20260822-027 — Packs D-AT: public naming deferred, not decided; 'packs' stays the config/internal term
  - dec-20260822-028 — Packs 4c: softCap is orthogonal to gate enforcement, verified not assumed -- no exemption needed for pack gates
  - dec-20260915-001 — rec-20260907-004's hono/fast-uri premise is discharged; current audit failure is a fresh js-yaml advisory
  - dec-20260915-003 — Inline gitleaks:allow comments do not retroactively suppress historical commits -- .gitleaksignore fingerprints are also required
  - dec-20260916-001 — Correction to dec-20260822-020: doctor's reachability scan is pack-aware since phase 302, not the deferred exception
  - dec-20260918-001 — D-BF-adjacent: classifyTier's minTasks floor is not wired into the coherence gate
- Files in play:
  - `packages/core/tsconfig.json` — affected by rec-20260907-002 packages/core/tsconfig.json includes only src/**/*, so no repo command ever typechecks tests/
  - `docs/reference/config.md` — affected by rec-20260917-008 docs/reference/config.md overclaims skill-audit: says it enforces skills were invoked 'during a phase', which the checkout-scoped invoked list does not support
  - `packages/core/src/parse/draft-parser.ts` — affected by rec-20260918-005 DRAFT.md with UTF-8 BOM (+ optionally CRLF) still throws the misleading 'missing frontmatter' error
  - `packages/core/src/parse/draft-mutate.ts` — affected by rec-20260918-006 draft-mutate.ts's add-ac/add-task splice regexes are \n-only, so a CRLF draft now fails with a different misleading error post-phase-310
  - `packages/core/src/parse/spec-parser.ts` — affected by rec-20260918-007 spec-parser.ts and ui-spec-parser.ts have the identical CRLF frontmatter-rejection bug phase 310 fixed for draft-parser.ts
  - `packages/core/src/parse/ui-spec-parser.ts` — affected by rec-20260918-007 spec-parser.ts and ui-spec-parser.ts have the identical CRLF frontmatter-rejection bug phase 310 fixed for draft-parser.ts

## What landed this session

Nothing new was built. The only action was landing already-prepared work from a prior session:

- Checked PR #521's merge status on request (it had been open, green, and waiting for consent since 2026-09-18). Re-confirmed CI was still green (`gh pr checks 521` — all passing, `ci-success` included) before merging.
- Squash-merged #521 (`225d9012`), deleted its branch.
- Pulling that merge in fast-forwarded local `main` past four other PRs that had landed on the other machine in the interim (#522-#525), including **phase 314**, which fixed the exact live gap this repo's own prior handoff (2026-09-18) had flagged: the Skill tool's invocation telemetry writing to the wrong `.cadence/state.json` when invoked from inside a worktree.
- Discovered (did not act on): PR #526, still open since 2026-09-18; and `docs/handoffs/HANDOFF-checkpoint-handoff-before-reset.md`, an uncommitted operator planning doc for a new initiative.

## Carry-forward gotchas

- **Multi-machine work needs an explicit sync check before trusting local `git log`.** This session's local `main` was 5 commits and 4 days behind `origin/main` without any error or warning — `git status` reported clean and "0 ahead / 0 behind" only because it hadn't fetched. Always `git fetch origin --prune` before trusting local branch/PR state when work may have happened elsewhere, not just at session start.
- **PR #526 has been sitting open, unreviewed, for 4 days.** Nobody has looked at whether it's ready, stale, or superseded by phase 314's fix. Check it before starting new phase-315 work — it may already BE phase 315's scoping, or it may need to be closed if phase 314 addressed enough of it.
- **`docs/handoffs/HANDOFF-checkpoint-handoff-before-reset.md` is a real, detailed, ready-to-execute proposal** (Phase 0 investigation + Phase 1 validator, both pre-authorized; Phases 2-6 explicitly need operator go-ahead) for a `/compact` replacement. It is currently untracked — not committed, not evaluated, not started. If the operator wants this pursued, it needs its own session; this handoff only surfaces that it exists.
- **`state.json` in this checkout still names a stale `activePhase: 311-...`** — a carried-forward, harmless artifact noted in the last two handoffs too; clears on the next `draft new`.
- **Local-machine-only cleanup candidates, not yet done** (all safe, none done this session since cleanup wasn't requested): remote branches `worktree-314-hook-shim-cwd-passthrough` and `worktree-roadmap-backfill-314` (both already merged via #524/#523), and the orphaned `docs/session-handoff-2026-09-18` (local+remote, predates even the phase-313 arc, never merged). The untracked `docs/handoffs/McAfee_Installer_...exe` file also remains — still not this repo's business, still worth the operator's own look on whichever machine it's sitting on.

## Next action

Two live threads, operator's call on which first:

1. **Triage PR #526** (`chore/phase-315-ledger-filing`, open since 2026-09-18). Read it fresh, check whether phase 314 already covered enough of what it scopes, and either land it or close it with a reason.
2. **Decide on `docs/handoffs/HANDOFF-checkpoint-handoff-before-reset.md`.** It's a fully-specified, pre-authorized Phase 0 (investigation, no code) that could start immediately if the operator wants it — or it can sit until a dedicated session picks it up. Not started here.

If neither is the priority: `cadence recommend` for the next ledger candidate, or `cadence draft new` for phase 315 once #526 is resolved one way or the other.
