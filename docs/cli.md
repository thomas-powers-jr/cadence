# CLI How-To Guide

This page shows worked, copy-pasteable invocations for the core
DRAFT→BUILD→SETTLE loop commands. It assumes the loop, gates, profiles, and
tiers are already familiar — if not, read [docs/concepts.md](concepts.md)
first.

The SPEC stage and the strategic-intelligence commands
(`recommendation` / `assumption` / `decision` / `intelligence` / `inspect` /
`recommend` / `milestone`, plus `spec` and `context`) are documented in
[docs/reference/commands.md](reference/commands.md), which also carries the
exhaustive option lists (every flag and its default).

> **Install:** `npm install -g @thomas-powers-jr/cadence-core` provides the
> `cadence` command used in every example below (requires Node ≥ 22).

## init — set up a project

Scaffold a `.cadence/` directory in the current repo root:

```sh
cadence init --name "my-project" --profile team --gate-profile standard
```

Options used above:

| Option | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `--name <project>` | Project name embedded in `PROJECT.md` |
| `--profile <preset>` | `solo` / `team` / `production` — sets the starting config preset |
| `--gate-profile <p>` | `strict` / `standard` / `auto` — overrides the gate profile CADENCE would suggest from git history |
| `--host <host>` | `claude` / `codex` — wire a host during init; `codex` also writes `AGENTS.md` |

For a first Codex run, use the full bootstrap before launching Codex:

```sh
cadence init --host codex
```

The plain Codex host installer only writes `.codex/hooks.json` and global
prompt files. `--host codex` also creates the project `.cadence/` state and the
managed `AGENTS.md` instructions that Codex reads at session start.

To regenerate only a managed agent-instruction block (e.g. after updating
CADENCE) on an already-initialized repo:

```sh
cadence init --claude-md
cadence init --agents-md
```

After `init`, commit `.cadence/` before starting any phase work.

---

## Draft workflow

A phase begins in IDLE and advances to BUILD only after a DRAFT is approved.

### draft new — scaffold a DRAFT

```sh
cadence draft new 01-retry 1 --title "Add retry logic"
```

Arguments: `<phase> <task-num>`. The draft id is derived as the first two
characters of the phase plus the zero-padded task number, so this creates:

```
.cadence/phases/01-retry/01-01-DRAFT.md
```

Open the file and replace the template placeholders:
- Frontmatter: `phase` / `id` / `tier` (`quick-fix` / `standard` / `complex`) / `status`
- `## Objective` — one-sentence description
- `## Acceptance Criteria` — at least one `### AC-N` block with `Given` / `When` / `Then`
- `## Tasks` — `### T1` blocks with `files` / `action` / `verify` / `done: AC-N`
- `## Boundaries` — what the AI must not change

For a first real task, use a template to avoid starting from a blank scaffold:

```sh
cadence draft new --title "Fix login timeout" --template bugfix
cadence draft new --title "Add CSV export" --template feature
cadence draft new --title "Split billing service" --template refactor
```

Templates generate editable Objective, AC, Task, and Boundary sections. They are
starting points for a human or agent to refine; they do not prove the work is
correct. The normal approve and settle gates still decide whether the phase can
close.

For a complex phase with an explicit tier:

```sh
cadence draft new 02-auth 3 --title "Refactor auth" --tier complex
```

### draft check — coherence-check before approve

Run the structural coherence check before committing to approve:

```sh
cadence draft check .cadence/phases/01-retry/01-01-DRAFT.md
```

The check validates tier vs task/file counts, AC format, and loop position.
Address any issues reported before proceeding to approve.

### draft approve — enter BUILD

```sh
cadence draft approve 01-retry 1
```

What happens at approve (depending on the gate set):
- `approve` gate: interactive Y/N prompt (TTY) or requires `--no-approve` flag
- `plan-review` gate: AI plan-review agent runs; `pass=false` refuses approve

For non-TTY environments (CI, hooks) when the `approve` gate is active:

```sh
cadence draft approve 01-retry 1 --no-approve
```

To proceed past a failing plan-review (findings are still printed):

```sh
cadence draft approve 01-retry 1 --allow-plan-review-failure
```

To override the `auto × complex` soft cap:

```sh
cadence draft approve 01-retry 1 --allow-auto-complex
```

After approve, the loop is in BUILD and task recording can begin.

---

## build task — record task outcomes

```sh
cadence build task T1 --status=DONE
```

```sh
cadence build task T2 --status=DONE --notes "Added retry with exponential backoff"
```

Valid `--status` values: `DONE` | `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` | `NEEDS_CONTEXT` | `BLOCKED`

When the `per-task-verify` gate is active (e.g. `strict × standard`), the
verifier runs on `--status=DONE` before accepting the status write. A `refuse`
verdict blocks the record unless bypassed:

```sh
cadence build task T1 --status=DONE --allow-per-task-failure
```

### Shortcut commands: done / block / needs-context

Three convenience shortcuts reduce typing for the most common statuses:

```sh
# Mark DONE
cadence done T1
cadence done T1 --notes "implemented with caching"

# Mark BLOCKED
cadence block T2 --notes "waiting for API spec"

# Mark NEEDS_CONTEXT
cadence needs-context T3 --notes "unclear which endpoint to use"
```

> **Carry-forward:** `block` and `needs-context` accept any string as `<id>`
> without validating it against the list of tasks declared in the active
> DRAFT. If you pass a misspelled or non-existent task id, the engine writes
> the record under that id and settle's structural gate will detect the
> inconsistency. Double-check task ids against the DRAFT before running these
> two shortcuts. `done` is unaffected — it is a true alias for `build task`
> (phase 281) and refuses an undeclared id outright (exit 2), recording
> nothing.

---

## settle run — close the loop

`settle run` closes the phase, runs the gate set, writes `SUMMARY.md` +
`SUMMARY.json`, and returns the loop to IDLE.

### Mode flags

**Manual AC verdicts** (always available):

```sh
cadence settle run --ac AC-1=pass --ac AC-2=pass
cadence settle run --ac AC-1=pass --ac AC-2=fail:tests-missing
```

**Auto mode** — derive AC verdicts from task statuses:

```sh
cadence settle run --auto
```

Blocks on incomplete or failed ACs. To settle past them anyway:

```sh
cadence settle run --auto --force
```

**Deep verify** — run the independent AI verifier against each AC:

```sh
cadence settle run --deep
```

The provider comes from `config.verifier`. See
[docs/providers.md](providers.md) for setup.

**Interactive** — walk each AC and enter a verdict at the prompt:

```sh
cadence settle run --interactive
```

Requires a TTY. In non-TTY environments, use `--no-interactive` to skip the
gate when the active profile would normally enforce it.

### Bypass flags

| Flag | Gate bypassed | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `--auto` | — | Derive verdicts from task statuses instead of providing them manually |
| `--force` | `deep-verify`, `interactive-verdict`, `code-review`, `security-audit` (all) | Force settle past any gate failure |
| `--allow-stale-draft` | `draft-read` | DRAFT.md was edited after approve |
| `--allow-open-tasks` | `structural-verifier` | A task is still PENDING / IN_PROGRESS |
| `--allow-failing-build` | `verification.testCommand` exit | Settle past a non-zero build/test exit |
| `--allow-missing-coverage` | `test-coverage` | AC token not found in any test file |
| `--allow-verifier-failure` | `deep-verify` transport errors | Record failure but don't refuse |
| `--allow-code-review-failure` | `code-review` HIGH-severity findings | Record findings but settle anyway |
| `--allow-security-audit-failure` | `security-audit` CRITICAL findings | Record findings but settle anyway |
| `--allow-skill-audit-miss` | `skill-audit` | Required skills were not invoked; emit a warn anomaly, record the bypass in `SUMMARY.gateBypasses` and settle anyway (Phase 34.1; recorded since Phase 311) |
| `--allow-unresolvable-pack` | `pack-resolution` | An enabled pack failed to resolve; record the bypass in `SUMMARY.gateBypasses` and settle anyway (Phase 291) |
| `--no-interactive` | `interactive-verdict` | Opt out of the interactive gate (profile-level bypass) |
| `--allow-auto-complex` | `auto × complex` soft cap | Override the soft cap |

For a full explanation of which gates fire in which profile × tier cell, see
[docs/concepts.md — Gate matrix](concepts.md#the-gate-universe).

## status — inspect loop state

Show full loop context: phase, draft, tasks, ACs, and next recommended action:

```sh
cadence status
```

Machine-readable JSON output (useful in scripts):

```sh
cadence status --json
```

List recorded anomaly events:

```sh
cadence status anomalies
```

---

## progress — next recommended action

Print a single recommended next action for the current loop position:

```sh
cadence progress
```

Useful as a quick orientation command after picking up a session. The host
adapter's `/cadence-progress` slash command calls this under the hood.

---

## config — read and write config

Print a config value by dotted path:

```sh
cadence config get verifier.provider
cadence config get perTaskVerifier.model
```

Update a config value (validated against the schema):

```sh
cadence config set verifier.provider anthropic
cadence config set codeReview.provider local
```

Diagnose config conflicts (e.g. provider set without required env vars):

```sh
cadence config doctor
```

The full list of config fields and presets is in
[docs/reference/config.md](reference/config.md).

---

## mcp serve — drive the loop from an MCP host

Run the engine as a local [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server over
stdio, so any MCP-capable host (Claude Desktop, Cursor, agents) can call the loop
as tools:

```sh
cadence mcp serve            # operate on the current working directory
cadence mcp serve --repo /path/to/project
```

It's a local subprocess, not a network service — the host launches it and talks
over stdin/stdout. It advertises 10 tools wrapping the same commands documented
above (`cadence_progress`/`status`/`recommend` read; `cadence_draft_new`/
`draft_check`/`draft_approve`/`build_task`/`settle`/`spec_new`/`spec_approve`
write). Command-boundary gates run exactly as on the CLI; ambient edit-time gates
require host hooks and are not available over MCP. Setup and the full tool table:
[docs/mcp.md](mcp.md).

---

## Hand the loop to your AI agent

    cadence agent-prompt --goal "fix the login timeout"

Prints a ready-to-paste prompt for your coding agent. Without `--goal` it prints
a `<your goal>` placeholder. The same block also appears at the end of
`cadence init`.

---

## Single-commit convention in practice

A completed phase produces exactly one commit. Here is what that looks like
for a phase called `P05 / T2`:

```sh
# 1. Do the work. Record task outcomes as you go.
cadence done T1
cadence done T2 --notes "added edge-case test"

# 2. Settle the loop. This writes SUMMARY.* and resets state to IDLE.
cadence settle run --auto

# 3. One commit: source changes + phase artifacts together.
git add src/ tests/ docs/ .cadence/
git commit -m "feat: add retry logic with exponential backoff (P05/T2)"
```

**Why one commit?** The gates already re-verified the work in step 2 —
there's nothing left to prove by splitting artifacts into a second commit.
One commit is the single atomic record of both the code change and the gate
outcomes/AC verdicts that backed it, keeping audit straightforward without
adding a step.

For the conceptual rationale, see
[docs/concepts.md — Single-commit convention](concepts.md#single-commit-convention).
